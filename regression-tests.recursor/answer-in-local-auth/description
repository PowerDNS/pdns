This test will test the fix made for issue #2600. When we receive a CNAME chain
in the ANSWER-section from an authoritative server, we should discard any record
in a zone that we (as a recursor) are authoritative for (by e.g. using auth-zones)

The issue here was that an auth returns the following CNAME chain (where the
auth server is indeed authoritative for all these zones):
service.box.answer-cname-in-local.example.net -->
  pfs.global.box.answer-cname-in-local.example.net -->
    vip-metropole.pfsbox.answer-cname-in-local.example.net

However, the resolver has the zone 'global.box.answer-cname-in-local.example.net'
loaded whereby the CNAME chain becomes:
service.box.answer-cname-in-local.example.net -->
  pfs.global.box.answer-cname-in-local.example.net -->
    vip-reunion.pfsbox.answer-cname-in-local.example.net

Hence, it should reject the last CNAME sent from the authoritative server.
