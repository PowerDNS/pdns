There are two ways to run these tests. The automated way is ./runtests which
tries to pick up a dnsdist binary built from a distributed tarball in
../pdns/dnsdistdist/dnsdist-*/dnsdist

If this is not the binary you want to test, use something like:

DNSDISTBIN=../pdns/dnsdistdist/dnsdist ./runtests

The tests are self-contained and require no further nameservers to be
installed.

However, do make sure to build a dnsdist with libsodium, dnscrypt, DoT and DoH
support as otherwise some tests will fail.

To run a specific test, use something like:

./runtests test_Advanced.py:TestAdvancedSpoof.testSpoofActionMultiA
