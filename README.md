SOURCE CODE / GIT
-----------------
Source code is available on GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns.git
```

This repository contains the sources for the PowerDNS Recursor, the PowerDNS
Authoritative Server, and dnsdist (a powerful DNS loadbalancer). All three can
be built from this repository. However, all three released separately as .tar.bz2,
.deb and .rpm.

COMPILING Authoritative Server
------------------------------
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server depends on Boost, OpenSSL and requires a
compiler with C++-2011 support.

On Debian 8.0, the following is useful:

```
$ apt-get install g++ libboost-all-dev libtool make pkg-config libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev
```

When building from git, the following packages are also required: autoconf, automake,
ragel, bison and flex, then generate the configure file:

```
$ ./bootstrap
```

To compile a very clean version, use:

```
$ ./configure --with-modules="" --without-lua
$ make
# make install
```

This generates a PowerDNS Authoritative Server binary with no modules built in.

When `./configure` is run without `--with-modules`, the bind and gmysql module are
built-in by default and the pipe-backend is compiled for runtime loading.

To add multiple modules, try:

```
$ ./configure --with-modules="bind gmysql gpgsql"
```

Note that you will need the development headers for PostgreSQL as well in this case.

See https://doc.powerdns.com/md/appendix/compiling-powerdns/ for more details.

If you run into C++11-related symbol trouble, please try passing `CPPFLAGS=-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` (or 1) to `./configure` to make sure you are compatible with the installed dependencies.

COMPILING THE RECURSOR
----------------------
See the README in pdns/recursordist.

COMPILING DNSDIST
----------------------
See the README in pdns/dnsdistdist.

SOLARIS NOTES
-------------
Use a recent gcc. OpenCSW is a good source, as is Solaris 11 IPS.

If you encounter problems with the Solaris make, gmake is advised.

FREEBSD NOTES
-------------
You need to compile using gmake - regular make only appears to work, but doesn't in fact. Use gmake, not make.

MAC OS X NOTES
--------------
PowerDNS Authoritative Server is available through Homebrew:

```
$ brew install pdns
```

If you want to compile yourself, the dependencies can be installed using
Homebrew:

```
$ brew install boost lua pkg-config ragel
```

For PostgreSQL support:

```
$ brew install postgresql
```

For MySQL support:

```
$ brew install mariadb
```

LINUX NOTES
-----------
If you running in to ```./bootstrap: 2: ./bootstrap: autoreconf: not found```, make sure you install
```
sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf
```
