  # The jobs below check that only the pinned version of Python3 packages are installed with pip. Running in a container, a
  # pip proxy registers all requests for installing packages with pip.  Then, the downloaded packages and their versions are compared
  # with the list used for the installation (i.e. docs/requirements.txt, pdns/recursordist/docs/requirements.txt, etc). If a package
  # is missing or a version does not match the one expected, this job fails, which makes the workflow fail.
  #
  # The pinned version plus hashes are generated using pip-compile using an input file that includes the original list of packages
  # (pip-compile --generate-hashes -U requirements.in). "pip-compile" can be installed via pip-tools with Python 3.11, which is the version
  # used in the CI. Any other Python version would end up with different versions for packages and could result in workflow failures.
  #
  # One recurring error thrown by this validation is when a new version of a pinned package is released for a "setup-requires" dependency
  # of one of the packages in the list (see https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/14596). The package version in “requirements.in” should
  # be modified to solve this issue. In some cases, it is enough to generate again the list of packages, making sure to add the -U flag
  # to force the upgrade: "pip-compile --generate-hashes -U requirements.in" (this could include upgrading other packages).
