PowerDNS is copyright 2002 by PowerDNS.COM BV

To compile a very clean version, use:

$ ./configure --with-modules=""
$ make
# make install

This generates a PowerDNS binary with no modules, except the bind backend,
built in. When ./configure is run without --with-modules, the mysql and
pgmysql modules is built by default, with the latter only supporting mysql.

To add multiple modules, try:

$ ./configure --with-modules="pipe pgmysql" --enable-mysql --enable-pgsql

See http://rtfm.powerdns.com/compiling-powerdns.html for more details.

Please don't use the 'mysql' backend, it is deprecated. Use the 'gmysql' one
that is in the pgmysql Generic PostgreSQL and MySQL module!

SOLARIS NOTES
-------------
You need gcc 3.x, preferably 3.2! The 'Sunpro' compiler is currently not
supported (patches are welcome if not too intrusive).
If you encounter problems with the Solaris make, gmake is advised

IPv6 is currently (2.9.1.) broken in Solaris, awaiting patches!

FREEBSD NOTES
-------------
gcc 2.95.x works. You need to compile using gmake - regular make only appears to
work, but doesn't in fact.

LINUX NOTES
-----------
None really.

WIN32 NOTES
-----------
For the brave! See
http://rtfm.powerdns.com/compiling-powerdns.html#ON-WINDOWS 

Needs Visual C++

---

After compiling, you may find the file 'pdns/pdns' helpful, we suggest you
place it in /etc/init.d/ or your operating system's equivalent.
