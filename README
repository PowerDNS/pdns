PowerDNS is copyright 2002 by PowerDNS.COM BV

To compile a very basic version, use:

$ ./configure --with-modules=""
$ make
# make install

This generates a PowerDNS binary with no modules, except the bind backend,
built in. When ./configure is run without --with-modules, the mysql module
is built by default.

To add multiple modules, try:

$ ./configure --with-modules="mysql mypgsql" --enable-mysql --enable-pgsql

SOLARIS NOTES
-------------
You need gcc 3.x, preferably 3.2!
If you encounter problems with the Solaris make, gmake is advised

IPv6 is currently (2.9.1.) broken in Solaris, awaiting patches!

FREEBSD NOTES
-------------
gcc 2.95.x works. You need to compile using gmake - regular make only appears to
work, but doesn't in fact.

LINUX NOTES
-----------
None really.

WIN32 NOTES
-----------
For the brave! See
http://rtfm.powerdns.com/compiling-powerdns.html#ON-WINDOWS 

Needs Visual C++

---

After compiling, you may find the file 'pdns/pdns' helpful, we suggest you
place it in /etc/init.d/ or your operating system's equivalent.
