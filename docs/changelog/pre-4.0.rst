Changes between RC2 and final
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  pdnssec rectify-zone now refuses to operate on presigned zones, as

   Monshouwer in `commit
   9bd211e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9bd211e>`__.
-  We now handle zones with a mix of NSEC3 opt-out and non-opt-out

   the parent, would wrongly get an 'unauth NOERROR'. Fixed by Kees
   Monshouwer in `commit
   34479a6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/34479a6>`__.

Changes between RC1 and RC2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added dnstcpbench tool, by popular demand.
-  We always shipped a static tools RPM; we now have a similar Debian
   package. All packages have been cleaned up a bit, and the binary
   collections are now consistent between RPM and Deb. New: pass
   ^^enable-tools to configure to have the tools included in 'make all'
   and 'make install'.
-  `commit 4d2e3f5 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4d2e3f5>`__:
   add selinux policy files
-  We would sometimes send a single NULL byte, or nothing at all,
   instead of an OPT record. Fixed in `commit
   bf7f822 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bf7f822>`__, `commit
   063076b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/063076b>`__, `commit

   `commit 7c0b859 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7c0b859>`__,
   `commit 5eea730 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5eea730>`__:
   Implement MINFO qtype for better interaction when slaving zones from
   NSD (that contain MINFO). Thanks to Jelte Jansen.
-  `commit 8655a42 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8655a42>`__,
   `commit bf79c6a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bf79c6a>`__,
   `commit 38c941b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/38c941b>`__:
   SRV record can have a '.' as final field, from which we would
   dutifully strip the trailing ., leaving void, confusing everything.
   We now remove the trailing . in the right place, and not if we are
   trying to server '.'. Again thanks to Jelte & SIDN for catching this.

   improve error message in ill formed unknown record type, thanks Jelte

   Built in webserver can now listen on IPv6, fixes `ticket
   843 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/843>`__. Also silences
   some useless messages about timeouts.
-  `commit 7db735c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7db735c>`__,
   `commit d72166c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d72166c>`__:
   CHANGES BEHAVIOUR: before we launch, check if we can connect to the
   controlsocket we are about to obliterate. If it works, abort. Fixes
   `ticket 841 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/841>`__ and
   changes standing behaviour. There might be circumstances where
   PowerDNS now refuses to start, where it previously would. However,
   starting and making our previous instance mute wasn't good.
-  `commit 9130f9e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9130f9e>`__:
   correctly refuse out-of-zone data in bindbackend, closes `ticket
   845 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/845>`__
-  `commit 3363ef7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/3363ef7>`__:

   through. Fixes situations where server-id was emptied explicitly.

   PowerDNS now sets additional groups while dropping privileges.
-  `commit 7796a3b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7796a3b>`__:
   Merge support for include-dir directive, thanks Aki Tuomi!
-  `commit d725755 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d725755>`__:
   make pdns-static Conflict with pdns-server, closes `ticket
   640 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/640>`__
-  `commit c0d5504 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c0d5504>`__:
   pdnssec now emits 'INSERT INTO domain ..' queries when running
   without named.conf, thanks Ruben d'Arco.
-  `commit a1d6b0c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a1d6b0c>`__:
   Older versions of the BIND 9 validating recursor need a superfluous
   NSEC3 record on positive wildcard responses. We now send this extra
   NSEC3. Closes `ticket
   814 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/814>`__.
-  `commit 07bf35d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/07bf35d>`__:
   catch a lot more errors in pdnssec and report them. Fixes `ticket
   588 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/588>`__.
-  `commit 032e390 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/032e390>`__:
   make pdnssec exit with 1 on some error conditions, closes `ticket
   677 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/677>`__
-  `commit 4af49b8 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4af49b8>`__,
   `commit 4cec6ac <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4cec6ac>`__:
   add ability to create an 'active' or inactive key using add-zone-key
   and import-zone-key, plus silenced some debugging. Fixes `ticket
   707 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/707>`__.
-  `commit fae4167 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/fae4167>`__:
   Compiling against Lua 5.2 (^^with-lua=lua5.2) now disables some code
   used for regression testing, instead of breaking during compile. This
   means that Lua 5.2 can be used in production.
-  `commit abc8f3f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/abc8f3f>`__,
   `357f6a7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/357f6a7>`__:
   Implement the new any-to-tcp option that, when set, always replies
   with a truncated response (TC=1) to ANY queries, forcing them to use
   TCP.
-  `commit 496073b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/496073b>`__:
   Since 3.0, pdnssec secure-zone has always generated 3 keys: one KSK
   and two ZSK, with one ZSK active. For most, if not almost all, users,
   this inactive ZSK is never used. We now no longer generate this
   useless ZSK. The resulting smaller DNSKEY RRset improves
   interoperability with certain validators. Closes `ticket
   824 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/824>`__.
-  `commit df55450 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/df55450>`__:
   Non-DNSSEC ANY queries no longer get sent DNSSEC records. This
   improves interoperability with some old resolvers. Patch by Kees
   Monshouwer.
-  `commit 04b4bf6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/04b4bf6>`__:
   Merge support for not using opt-out with NSEC3. Many thanks to Kees
   Monshouwer.
-  `commit 8db49a6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8db49a6>`__:
   We now try not to NOTIFY ourselves. In convoluted cases involving
   REUSE\_PORT and binding to 0.0.0.0 and ::, it might be possible that
   we guess wrong, in which case you can set prevent-self-notification
   to off.

Important bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `commit 63e365d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/63e365d>`__:

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.2
---------------------------------

Released January 17th, 2013

This is a stability and conformity update to 3.1. It mostly makes our
DNSSEC implementation more robust, and improves interoperability with
various validators. 3.2 has received very extensive testing on a lot of
edge cases, verifying output both against common validators and compared
against other authoritative servers.

**Warning**: Version 3.2 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a major
upgrade if you are coming from 2.9.x. There are also some important
changes if you are coming from 3.0 or 3.1. Please refer to the `Upgrade
documentation <../upgrading.rst>`__ for important information
on correct and stable operation, as well as notes on performance and
memory use.

Changes between 3.2-RC4 and the final 3.2 release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Aki Tuomi contributed a bunch of fixes to our crypto drivers. Code in
   `commit 9b9fca6867fa20caa905c35faa3631781e88a743 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9b9fca6867fa20caa905c35faa3631781e88a743>`__ and

-  The ksk\|zsk argument for pdnssec import-zone-key was required while
   it should be optional. Fixed in `commit d1eacbeb2be9fd2ef2faa3c867b4a934da637444 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d1eacbeb2be9fd2ef2faa3c867b4a934da637444>`__.

Changes between 3.2-RC3 and 3.2-RC4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The experimental undocumented bindbackend superslave mode would break
   the first added domain until a restart. Fixed by Kees Monshouwer in

-  Sander Hoentjen reported an issue with our choice of ports for
   outgoing TCP connections. Investigating it turned up that we were
   randomizing TCP connections on purpose while leaving UDP port choice
   to the kernel, which should be the other way around. Fixed in `commit eabdf7e0405bc12b93f9f3cb8a9e3e41f20452d3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/eabdf7e0405bc12b93f9f3cb8a9e3e41f20452d3>`__,

   closing `ticket 458 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/458>`__.
-  The MongoDB backend was removed at the author's request, as it does
   not work with any current libmongo versions. Change in `commit 8ecbcd268e0b9d8ab37d8d06c03f457af8a4475c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8ecbcd268e0b9d8ab37d8d06c03f457af8a4475c>`__.
-  Mark Zealey discovered we were retrieving the ascii powerdns version
   string for each packet, not just for version string queries. Fixed in
   `commit be6c6b392496d22b8221d597ad6d20141326e774 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/be6c6b392496d22b8221d597ad6d20141326e774>`__,
   closing `ticket 651 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/651>`__.

-  Mark Zealey noted that RRs with low TTLs could lower our
   query-cache-ttl persistently. Fixed in `commit 46c6efbe2e2b4ca6fa31e586ff1613094fda17f0 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/46c6efbe2e2b4ca6fa31e586ff1613094fda17f0>`__,

-  pdnssec now honours module-dir, patch by Fredrik Danerklint in
   `commit 966828ac4c6c97b0594bd989eb9c4c628f2924d6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/966828ac4c6c97b0594bd989eb9c4c628f2924d6>`__.

Changes between 3.2-RC2 and 3.2-RC3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Michael Scheffler noticed that the lazy-recursion setting had no
   effect at all. Setting removed in `commit 431855d41911327c9a8253601d6513549e49ec66 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/431855d41911327c9a8253601d6513549e49ec66>`__.
-  Mark Zealey found that an earlier performance improvement could cause
   crashes under high load, with lots of IPs configured in local-address
   and receiver-threads greater than 1. Fixed in `commit 223066c673f3ec76757ff34b497d5ae86c815f2c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/223066c673f3ec76757ff34b497d5ae86c815f2c>`__.

Changes between 3.2-RC1 and 3.2-RC2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The udp-queries metric would only count on the first thread launched,
   instead of on all threads. Additionally, it was initialised at MAXINT
   at startup, instead of at 0. Both issues fixed by Kees Monshouwer in
   `commit 90b072846387597a834de4f929b60c53e62628c7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/90b072846387597a834de4f929b60c53e62628c7>`__,
   closing `ticket 491 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/491>`__
   and `ticket 582 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/582>`__.
-  Aki Tuomi contributed zone2json, a great way for programmers to
   benefit from our zone file parser. Code in `commit ee681377a95d31bfba481ad46b7f5b23b771a0d6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ee681377a95d31bfba481ad46b7f5b23b771a0d6>`__,
   closes `ticket 509 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/509>`__.
-  Our DNS TXT parser is not 8-bit safe, but our DNS TXT writer assumes
   the reader is! Reported by Jan-Piet Mens in `ticket
   541 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/541>`__, `commit 5dba9d254f3bc97ade939bc8b344394cd469daf4 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5dba9d254f3bc97ade939bc8b344394cd469daf4>`__ fixes
   our writer but not yet our parser.
-  Ruben d'Arco did some improvements to the MyDNS backend, and provided
   a full test suite for it, that we now run after every commit. Code in
   `commit 267af0fbc3cdda20aa397f243e1de7ba57e54d1a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/267af0fbc3cdda20aa397f243e1de7ba57e54d1a>`__.
-  Some exceptions from backends would lose their meaning while bubbling
   up. Fixed by Aki Tuomi in `commit 06ad4526fbde236869b89f1ef644ace9fb5955c4 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/06ad4526fbde236869b89f1ef644ace9fb5955c4>`__,
   closing `ticket 639 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/639>`__.
-  The packet-cache honours max reply length while matching cached
   packets against queries, but not EDNS status. This would mean that
   EDNS-enabled replies with a 512 reply len could be returned on
   non-EDNS queries. Spotted while investigating a report from Winfried
   Angele, patched by Ruben d'Arco in `commit 17d0b1e67010ee9813d2acddf3bef40fc6d78482 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/17d0b1e67010ee9813d2acddf3bef40fc6d78482>`__,
   closing `ticket 630 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/630>`__.
-  Errors involving creating, deletion or changing permissions on the
   control socket were unclear. Ruben d'Arco improved this in `commit aac4004167179fc5196a9186dead96781c42e2c9 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/aac4004167179fc5196a9186dead96781c42e2c9>`__.
-  pipe-timeout was always documented to be in milliseconds, but it
   turns out it was in seconds! `commit ecc96bb7ead552fdb0d5f3ca99e95aaeafa70589 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ecc96bb7ead552fdb0d5f3ca99e95aaeafa70589>`__
   changes them to actually be in ms, and 'increases' the default from
   1000 seconds to 2000 milliseconds.
-  Some exceptions would get dropped during inbound AXFR, yielding a log
   file that says 'transaction started' and nothing after that, making
   AXFR fail silently. `commit 7f450125540eefd692898131a01381a31ba7b87f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7f450125540eefd692898131a01381a31ba7b87f>`__ and
   `commit 480fbb4095158c6acde5765cbd14896adfd25576 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/480fbb4095158c6acde5765cbd14896adfd25576>`__
   improve this somewhat.
-  We now error out on empty labels inside of names (www..example.com)
   instead of generating bogus reply packets. Code in `commit 91567562eade07b35200ca916c24c415c4ef4bc4 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/91567562eade07b35200ca916c24c415c4ef4bc4>`__,
   reported by several users.
-  Doing chmod before chown, instead of the other way around, apparently
   avoids requiring a whole SELinux capability. Reported by Sander
   Hoentjen, fixed in `commit 7505c18d1181fa35271f9b4baaf752904b6f4811 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7505c18d1181fa35271f9b4baaf752904b6f4811>`__.
-  Chris Hofstaedtler fixed a bug in our Debian init.d script. Code
   in `commit 51d71c7771ed61459c898688f3afd054d4e3eefd <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/51d71c7771ed61459c898688f3afd054d4e3eefd>`__.
-  Superslave errors ('Unable to find backend willing to host ..') now
   include the NSset found at the master, to aid debugging. Code in
   `commit a7372c6fc0e9872cfe442ef0a990d9b85e7f16c9 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a7372c6fc0e9872cfe442ef0a990d9b85e7f16c9>`__.
-  `commit e237ea0468d61a10fe02ed4fa1df61e14d9e7d39 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e237ea0468d61a10fe02ed4fa1df61e14d9e7d39>`__ in
   RC1 broke compilation without SQLite3 and made query logging
   unreliable. Fixed in `commit c507b8224b22698f428848d582529cc709c1e505 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c507b8224b22698f428848d582529cc709c1e505>`__,
   `commit a464c196640d9fede553e413935f9dd3133ba59e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a464c196640d9fede553e413935f9dd3133ba59e>`__.
-  The dnsreplay tool now processes single packet pcaps. Fix in `commit cc4d4e8f3c0b702613c720c5706c9450bac3bb88 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/cc4d4e8f3c0b702613c720c5706c9450bac3bb88>`__.
-  PowerDNS always derives NSEC/NSEC3 from the actual zone content. To
   accommodate this, zone2sql now drops NSEC/NSEC3 records, as those
   should never be in a PowerDNS backend directly (`commit 88a7d2c157368678ebbb4070bdc15a1c70ed8fdc <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/88a7d2c157368678ebbb4070bdc15a1c70ed8fdc>`__),
   bindbackend ignores NSEC/NSEC3 while reading zonefiles (`commit c884525828916a98871a6c17567d24d12a265f2f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c884525828916a98871a6c17567d24d12a265f2f>`__) and
   pdnssec reports NSEC/NSEC3 in the database as an error condition
   (`commit 0aabca97c5d654bd3f464cc1bad1c7e4f717b16b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0aabca97c5d654bd3f464cc1bad1c7e4f717b16b>`__).
-  The bindbackend now ignores NSEC/NSEC3 records while reading
   zonefiles. Change in `commit c884525828916a98871a6c17567d24d12a265f2f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c884525828916a98871a6c17567d24d12a265f2f>`__.
-  An EXPERIMENTAL feature ('direct-dnskey') for reading ZSKs from the
   records table/your BIND zonefile was added in `commit 4a6ea260e77857625d37763529ebc5d57f584eba <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4a6ea260e77857625d37763529ebc5d57f584eba>`__,

-  While fully optional, PowerDNS supports direct RRSIG queries. Kees
   Monshouwer improved on our behaviour for those queries in `commit 14b8677552842725c4d6329e625230f42c469eba <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/14b8677552842725c4d6329e625230f42c469eba>`__.
-  IPv6 glue situations require AAAA records for the receiving end of a
   delegation in the ADDITIONAL section of a referral. This was
   supported ('do-ipv6-additional-processing') but not enabled by
   default. `commit 61bf4182246befd67087e9f3a77f8113ae3ce830 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/61bf4182246befd67087e9f3a77f8113ae3ce830>`__
   enables it by default.
-  pdnssec check-zone now warns for CNAME-and-other data at names in
   your zones. Code by Ruben d'Arco in `commit 61717a5121b2416d6173bb70e8ebd05f9392e638 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/61717a5121b2416d6173bb70e8ebd05f9392e638>`__.
-  Positive ANY-responses would include a spurious NSEC3. Corrected in

-  The ldapbackend now allows overriding the base dn for AXFR subtree
   search. Fixed in `commit 7e2219a10be897d88811553f890a37e8bcc8f340 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7e2219a10be897d88811553f890a37e8bcc8f340>`__,

Changes below are in 3.2-RC1 and up.

DNSSEC changes in 3.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Kees Monshouwer did a tremendous amount of work to improve and
   perfect our DNSSEC implementation, mostly in the NSEC3 area. Code in
   `commit 75a89ce6063c43b8a7a91e5312a42dd0cc21972a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/75a89ce6063c43b8a7a91e5312a42dd0cc21972a>`__,
   `commit bf5e9b0c672c6a2041df7545a22cba85fac8ba95 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bf5e9b0c672c6a2041df7545a22cba85fac8ba95>`__,
   `commit f76203f2e6883dc3f3fb4c397cf9c26aafa8a7d6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f76203f2e6883dc3f3fb4c397cf9c26aafa8a7d6>`__,
   fixing `ticket 486 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/486>`__,
   `ticket 537 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/537>`__, `ticket
   540 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/540>`__. He also
   implemented support for Empty Non-Terminals, code in `commit b5baefafdf6413af8e4a4b0848a6139700342d6f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b5baefafdf6413af8e4a4b0848a6139700342d6f>`__,
   `commit ece45ffbf50044a09e2dbd15149dec289693f400 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ece45ffbf50044a09e2dbd15149dec289693f400>`__,
   `commit 0c13544c3d03a74104a018218bb4e68e4dfa3f01 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0c13544c3d03a74104a018218bb4e68e4dfa3f01>`__,
   fixing `ticket 127 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/127>`__
   and `ticket 558 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/558>`__.
-  Presigned wildcard operation was improved with the help of many
   parties (see commit message for `commit f1485b68c67be1b77acfd93b33e8011d297b2c1d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f1485b68c67be1b77acfd93b33e8011d297b2c1d>`__).
   Presigned operation was also changed to be more consistent with
   master/live-signing operation. Code and a full test suite in `commit 794c2f9267376a304256dd87a150959e90385f11 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/794c2f9267376a304256dd87a150959e90385f11>`__,
   which also improves TTL behaviour for various situations. Fixes
   `ticket 460 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/460>`__, `ticket
   533 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/533>`__, `ticket
   559 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/559>`__.
-  Depending on database & locale settings, names starting with
   underscore would sometimes cause broken records. `commit a5f6886f058331a1193f0d5759128e701ef73849 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a5f6886f058331a1193f0d5759128e701ef73849>`__
   contains schema and code changes for the gpgsql and gmysql backends
   to sort this (no pun intended) definitively, closing `ticket
   550 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/550>`__. In addition, a
   pdnssec test-schema command was added (experimental and incomplete).
   It can be used to verify underscore sorting and a few other
   parameters of the database. Code in `commit 46d2e0d67290911cc8b92f19cf273d6a8a8eb6ae <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/46d2e0d67290911cc8b92f19cf273d6a8a8eb6ae>`__.
-  We now always include an EDNS section in responses to queries that
   also had an EDNS section. This was thought to improve BIND
   interoperability, but this turned out to be false. In any case, this
   change improves standards compliance. Spotted by Mats Dufberg, code
   in `commit f20d53711433013f409ef6685723bdaab1958349 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f20d53711433013f409ef6685723bdaab1958349>`__.
-  It turns out we were storing Botan keys the wrong way. Botan did not
   care but Polar did, causing interoperability problems. Fixed in
   `commit 50f1c2555dc892f6ca9f787e8bad1b6b1f614855 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/50f1c2555dc892f6ca9f787e8bad1b6b1f614855>`__, with
   the kind help of Paul Bakker of PolarSSL. Fixes `ticket
   492 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/492>`__ as reported by
   Florian Obser via Debian.
-  pdnssec add-zone-key now defaults to RSASHA256, like secure-zone
   already did. Code in `commit 0ba8e0f16823ee924c16e5cc3ba74729fe27eb93 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0ba8e0f16823ee924c16e5cc3ba74729fe27eb93>`__.
-  pdns\_control purge now also purges DNSSEC-related caches (keys and
   metadata). Code in `commit 627d2ca288d14b2023e40694a9ee4b5b44afddef <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/627d2ca288d14b2023e40694a9ee4b5b44afddef>`__, by
   Ruben d'Arco. Fixes `ticket
   530 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/530>`__.
-  The signer thread would die in specific situations, leaving you with
   a non-working but very busy system. Fixed in `commit 05cc368b24effceada1bdaadae060f789ddf3988 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/05cc368b24effceada1bdaadae060f789ddf3988>`__,
   `commit a4da80fc3ca81660527e053828de3a0b49df2a2b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a4da80fc3ca81660527e053828de3a0b49df2a2b>`__,
   closing `ticket 517 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/517>`__.
-  pdnssec secure-zone now warns when you just signed a slave zone.
   Suggested by Mark Scholten, code in `commit 3bf071227b6e93f99a21ccf936ee2105826b69d8 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/3bf071227b6e93f99a21ccf936ee2105826b69d8>`__,
   closes `ticket 592 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/592>`__.
-  pdnssec check-zone now warns about out-of-zone data. Patch by Kees
   Monshouwer in `commit b191a8357b9093317d4e918ca9f756f508afccb1 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b191a8357b9093317d4e918ca9f756f508afccb1>`__,
   closing `ticket 604 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/604>`__.
-  pdnssec now honours ^^no-config. Patch by Kees Monshouwer in `commit f78b02f35872d5022f736f5c95510a252435a26b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f78b02f35872d5022f736f5c95510a252435a26b>`__.
-  Various fixes for bindbackend presigned operation, mostly by Kees
   Monshouwer. Code in `commit b563f71b3352b62f4fc3c8f25638be54c8e01f25 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b563f71b3352b62f4fc3c8f25638be54c8e01f25>`__,
   closing `ticket 600 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/600>`__.
-  Bindbackend could get confused about domain metadata, sometimes even
   causing hangs. Fixes by Kees Monshouwer in `commit 7c85a8913981470f0c8344b6d997fd05ead3ef18 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7c85a8913981470f0c8344b6d997fd05ead3ef18>`__ and
   `commit 14b7e03bbb05fc02ec89f46c71755b06fb87b1b3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/14b7e03bbb05fc02ec89f46c71755b06fb87b1b3>`__,
   closing `ticket 600 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/600>`__
   and `ticket 603 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/603>`__.
-  SQL queries in gsql backends that reference the domain\_id column
   have been made explicit about from what table they want this column.
   This makes it easier to operate custom schemas without changing the
   queries. Fix by Nicky Gerritsen in `commit 36dea203880a0bf9bbf7414a97c91517a293ac3c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/36dea203880a0bf9bbf7414a97c91517a293ac3c>`__.
-  In various situations involving CNAMEs and wildcards, and for ANY
   queries involving CNAMEs, we would sometimes return bogus results.

   Kees Monshouwer.
-  rectify-zone accidentally set auth=1 on NS records of secure
   delegations. Reported by George Notaras, fixed by Kees Monshouwer in
   `commit c2df797edccd2e8e7494d8ab658f345bd97ae89a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c2df797edccd2e8e7494d8ab658f345bd97ae89a>`__,
   closing `ticket 605 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/605>`__.
-  The DNSSEC signature cache now actually gets cleaned up, avoiding
   lasting spikes in memory usage every thursday. Code in `commit ccc3f9ed0fdcdbd0457f5d8f10d72893ed0bc02c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ccc3f9ed0fdcdbd0457f5d8f10d72893ed0bc02c>`__ and

   closing `ticket 594 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/594>`__.
-  Signatures used to roll at midnight on thursday. We now roll them one
   hour after midnight, with inception still set to midnight, to allow
   for some variations in clock quality on resolvers. Code in `commit d90efbf48f3b8bad8f29610583f6349b7ae3d802 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d90efbf48f3b8bad8f29610583f6349b7ae3d802>`__.
-  Duplicate records (same name/type/content/priority) would sometimes
   get broken RRSIGs during outgoing AXFR. Fixed in `commit a2f3b9ec1f1cba1146ccf9294a1d15f5590e4975 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a2f3b9ec1f1cba1146ccf9294a1d15f5590e4975>`__.
-  A root zone (name="") with DNSSEC would cause crashes in some
   situations. Reported by Luuk Hendriks. Fixed in `commit 8e90e4284aa143433cd6d0c424b460c2406e108f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8e90e4284aa143433cd6d0c424b460c2406e108f>`__,

-  When a name is matched only by a wildcard, but the type in the query
   is not present, we would be lacking one NSEC/NSEC3 record to prove the
   existence of the wildcard. Fixed by Kees Monshouwer in `commit 7bb8e2026c204f3356bfde3634a297f05aad0b4e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7bb8e2026c204f3356bfde3634a297f05aad0b4e>`__ and

-  Luuk Hendriks spotted that our PolarSSL RSA key generation code was
   using inferior entropy. This can be important on virtual machines
   with badly implemented clocks. Fixed in `commit 802da34574540238df2b470e9c85823e89e10024 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/802da34574540238df2b470e9c85823e89e10024>`__,

Non-DNSSEC improvements/changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Bindbackend would sometimes crash on startup, due to a
   sync\_with\_stdio call. This call has been moved to pdns\_server
   proper to occur before any threads are spawned, avoiding race
   conditions in this call. Note that this crash has only been observed
   twice in thousands of regression test runs and has never been
   reported in the real world. Change in `commit 35b9a6ffb0ebd0ba10426c93f2095d8dd2036493 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/35b9a6ffb0ebd0ba10426c93f2095d8dd2036493>`__.
-  Leen Besselink submitted query logging support for the SQLite3 parts
   in the bindbackend. Code in `commit e237ea0468d61a10fe02ed4fa1df61e14d9e7d39 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e237ea0468d61a10fe02ed4fa1df61e14d9e7d39>`__.
-  Multi-backend operation would sometimes cause garbage domain IDs to
   be passed to backends. Reported by Kees Monshouwer and fixed by him
   in `commit c27c8d96f9a62d7744cf8b12c88846d15fdd2728 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c27c8d96f9a62d7744cf8b12c88846d15fdd2728>`__.
-  Bindbackend would sometimes crash during reloads/rediscovers. The
   changes in `commit a3047110df07009ea9d572e2cd1098cb106d337c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a3047110df07009ea9d572e2cd1098cb106d337c>`__ get
   rid of the crash, at the cost of returning SERVFAIL during reloads.
   Closes `ticket 564 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/564>`__.
-  Our label decompression code was naive, causing troubles for slaving
   of very specifically formatted zones. Fix in `ticket
   2822 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/2822>`__, closes
   `ticket 599 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/599>`__.
-  Bindbackend slaves would choke on unknown RR types and do silly
   things with RP and SRV records. Fixed in `commit 815caf66c9907703f4c7424ab16eb332a728b25d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/815caf66c9907703f4c7424ab16eb332a728b25d>`__ and

-  The luabackend can now compile against Lua 5.2. Patch by Fredrik
   Danerklint in `commit 67f30c7437daa8d334eff8a040c92f3954b504d0 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/67f30c7437daa8d334eff8a040c92f3954b504d0>`__,

-  A new backend, the 'Remote backend' `Remote
   Backend <../backends/remote.rst>`__ was submitted by Aki
   Tuomi. It aims to replace the pipebackend with a better protocol and
   support for more connection methods, including HTTP. Code in `commit bf42c81738795d53daee615224194213dd320250 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bf42c81738795d53daee615224194213dd320250>`__,

Assorted bugfixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  If a slave domain is removed while a transfer to it is queued, we no
   longer try the transfer. This also avoids a rare crash in similar
   circumstances. Code in `commit f9fa0e2de8c0c4a83a4104dfa3120c8e64f6c15b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f9fa0e2de8c0c4a83a4104dfa3120c8e64f6c15b>`__,

 PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.1
----------------------------------

Released on the 4th of May 2012 RC3 released on the 30th of April 2012
RC2 released on the 14th of April 2012 RC1 released on the 23th of March
2012

**Warning**: Version 3.1 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a major
upgrade if you are coming from 2.9.x. There are also some important
changes if you are coming from 3.0. Please refer to the `Upgrade
documentation <../upgrading.rst>`__ for important information
on correct and stable operation, as well as notes on performance and
memory use.

Version 3.1 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server represents the 'coming
of age' of our DNSSEC implementation. In addition, 3.1 solves a lot of
'.0' issues typically associated with a major new release.

As usual, we are very grateful for the involvement of the PowerDNS
community. The uptake of 3.0 was rapid, and many users were very helpful
in shaking out the bugs, and willing to test the fixes we provided or,
in many cases, provided the fixes themselves.

Of specific note is the giant PowerDNS DNSSEC deployment in Sweden by
Atomia and Binero. PowerDNS 3.0 now powers over 150000 DNSSEC domains in
Sweden, around 95% of all DNSSEC domains, in a country were most
internet service providers actually validate all .SE domains.

Finally, this release has benefited a lot from Peter van Dijk joining
us, as he has merged a tremendous amount of patches, cleaned up years of
accumulated dust in the code, and massively improved our regression
testing into a full blown continuous integration setup with full DNSSEC
tests!

Additionally, we would like to thank Ruben d'Arco, Jose Arthur Benetasso
Villanova, Marc Haber, Jimmy Bergman, Aki Tuomi and everyone else who
helped us out!

   Monshouwer, fixed in `commit da6a292656ba9a113a008bf96fac6499e0043ed3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/da6a292656ba9a113a008bf96fac6499e0043ed3>`__.

Changes between RC2 and RC3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The hidden test-algorithms command for pdnssec now has a little
   brother 'test-algorithm X'. Code in `commit cbb0025bb3887aa03e4392a9f3eb12af7a903cac <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/cbb0025bb3887aa03e4392a9f3eb12af7a903cac>`__, by
   Aki Tuomi.
-  PolarSSL upgraded to 1.1.2 due to weak RSA key generation (`commit f48b4a12a2fc48d4aeeb76dee1721e4a1a83b75a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f48b4a12a2fc48d4aeeb76dee1721e4a1a83b75a>`__). If
   you created RSA keys with RC1 or RC2 using PolarSSL, please replace
   them! This upgrade introduced a slowdown; speedup patch in `commit 73fae989c7bc276c0be5d4bb4618c6929fc3a6a5 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/73fae989c7bc276c0be5d4bb4618c6929fc3a6a5>`__.
-  It turns out we were using libmysqlclient in a thread-unsafe manner.
   This issue was reported and painstakingly debugged by Marc Haber.
   Presumably fixed in `commit b87bd70860f12824262b995dd791423661f68182 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b87bd70860f12824262b995dd791423661f68182>`__.

-  NSEC/NSEC3 bitmaps can now cover RRtypes above 255. Reported by Michael
   Braunoeder, patch by Aki Tuomi in `commit 5b7f65461b656ce554d392e903c92091370a0dfd <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5b7f65461b656ce554d392e903c92091370a0dfd>`__.
-  pdnssec check-zone now reports MBOXFW and URL records (as those are
   unsupported since 3.0). Reported by Gerwin Krist of Digitalus, patch
   by Ruben d'Arco. Closes `ticket
   446 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/446>`__.
-  The odbcbackend was removed. It only runs on Windows and Windows is
   unsupported since 3.0. Removal in `commit 861af1d989fde1cf150507bac2d73c8279db6404 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/861af1d989fde1cf150507bac2d73c8279db6404>`__.
-  We used to send the chunk length and the actual chunk in two separate
   writes (often resulting in two separate TCP packets) during outbound
   AXFR. This confused MSDNS. We now combine those writes. Code in
   `commit fbaa5e098fbf7ce5d6a0a1beae5081b6c8d79e66 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/fbaa5e098fbf7ce5d6a0a1beae5081b6c8d79e66>`__.

-  NSEC/NSEC3 logic for picking 'boundary' names was tricky, and got it
   wrong in some cases. Fixes in `commit bc74a0782194b6159082e67a06b7689bfecc5d62 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bc74a0782194b6159082e67a06b7689bfecc5d62>`__,

-  The subtle differences between 'what records get NSEC', 'what records
   get NSEC3' and 'what records should get signed' did not translate
   well to the SQL auth column. We now use 'ordername IS NULL' to map
   the whole spectrum. Code in `commit 270454105a33eed1c417af4a22e65a13912f6507 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/270454105a33eed1c417af4a22e65a13912f6507>`__,

   Closes `ticket 411 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/411>`__.
-  Spotted & fixed by Jimmy Bergman of Atomia, we now allow direct RRSIG
   queries even when do=0.
-  Spotted by Mark Scholten and Marco Davids, we would sometimes
   generate duplicate (and wrong) RRSIGs when signing an ANY answer
   because of record jumbling. Fix in `commit dca357a19895ba6a203eeeee5b2adbd4b090e1b4 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/dca357a19895ba6a203eeeee5b2adbd4b090e1b4>`__.

-  We now lowercase the signer name in an RRSIG. This is not mandated by
   DNSSEC specification but it improves compatibility with some
   validators. Fix in `commit c3a6f4ceeef899f9782ac3a63c706d2fd650f509 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c3a6f4ceeef899f9782ac3a63c706d2fd650f509>`__.

   closes `ticket 402 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/402>`__.
-  The PIPE backend issues frequent fork()s, leading to potential fd
   leaks if these are not marked as 'close on exec'. Solved in `commit 42c235e574b189dc923a656f59ca612f2b676bee <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/42c235e574b189dc923a656f59ca612f2b676bee>`__,

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0.1
-----------------------------------

**Warning**: The DNSSEC implementation of PowerDNS Authoritative Server
3.0 and 3.0.1 contains many issues regarding CNAMES, wildcards and
(in)secure delegations. If you use any of these, and you use DNSSEC you
MUST upgrade to 3.1 or beyond!

3.0.1 consists of 3.0, plus the patch from `PowerDNS Security Advisory
2012-01 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2012-01.rst>`__

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0
---------------------------------

Released on the 22nd of July 2011 RC1 released on the 4th of April 2011
RC2 released on the 19th of April 2011 RC3 released on the 19th of July
2011

**Warning**: Version 3.0 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a major
upgrade if you are coming from 2.9.x. Please refer to the `Upgrade
documentation <../upgrading.rst>`__ for important information
on correct and stable operation, as well as notes on performance and
memory use.

**Warning**: The DNSSEC implementation of PowerDNS Authoritative Server
3.0 and 3.0.1 contains many issues regarding CNAMES, wildcards and
(in)secure delegations. If you use any of these, and you use DNSSEC you
MUST upgrade to 3.1 or beyond!

Version 3.0 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server brings a number of
important features, as well as over two years of accumulated bug fixing.

The largest news in 3.0 is of course the advent of DNSSEC. Not only does
PowerDNS now (finally) support DNSSEC, we think that our support of this
important protocol is among the easiest to use available. In addition,
all important algorithms are supported.

Complete detail can be found in `Serving authoritative DNSSEC
data <../dnssec/intro.rst>`__. The goal of PowerDNS's DNSSEC support
is to allow existing PowerDNS installations to start serving DNSSEC with
as little hassle as possible, while maintaining performance and
achieving high levels of security.

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0 development has been made possible by
the financial and moral support of

-  `AFNIC, the French registry <https://www.afnic.fr/>`__
-  `IPCom's RcodeZero Anycast
   DNS <https://web.archive.org/web/20160306182714/http://www.rcodezero.at/index.php?id=1165&L=1>`__, a subsidiary
   of NIC.AT, the Austrian registry
-  `SIDN, the Dutch registry <https://www.sidn.nl/>`__

This release has received exceptional levels of community support, and
we'd like to thank the following people in addition to those mentioned

Known issues as of RC3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Not all new features are fully documented yet

Changes between RC3 and final
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Slight tweak to the pipebackend to ease DNSSEC operations (`commit 42f1cf3eccbc27e2b67ab3428c89bcdde6fd3b81 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/42f1cf3eccbc27e2b67ab3428c89bcdde6fd3b81>`__,
   `commit 0a2915e2127f3968082f0a5e42ca7d5b1b8227ea <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0a2915e2127f3968082f0a5e42ca7d5b1b8227ea>`__).
   Also fix pipebackend support in pdnssec tool (`commit c6347f61b9b25e640620c95910792bd8ce6c9c3c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c6347f61b9b25e640620c95910792bd8ce6c9c3c>`__).
-  Upgrade the experimental native Lua backend to the latest version
   from Fredrik Danerklint (`commit 244828bf698549bffce23eb8736059ab86bcf763 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/244828bf698549bffce23eb8736059ab86bcf763>`__) and
   include this backend in the .deb packages (`commit 9a7f942c01b26632aa3c227e9d2d831819909a7c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9a7f942c01b26632aa3c227e9d2d831819909a7c>`__)
-  Remove IPv6 dependency, it was only possible to run master/slave
   operations on a server with at least one IPv6 address. Some very old
   virtualized setups turned out to have no IPv6 at all. Fix in `commit 6a2df3f610e9fccc70c70059c8bee1b00124d35d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/6a2df3f610e9fccc70c70059c8bee1b00124d35d>`__.

Changes between RC2 and RC3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS Authoritative Server could not be configured to use an IPv6
   based resolving backend. Solved in `commit c0cc655925c0e70751aa4cfd08434983df9b3ea5 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c0cc655925c0e70751aa4cfd08434983df9b3ea5>`__.
-  LDAP backend reconfigured the timezone (TZ) setting of the daemon,
   leading to confusing logfile entries. Fixed by Chris Hofstaedtler
   in `commit 609db699dc584fc48d80505d9eddb79b7674b83b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/609db699dc584fc48d80505d9eddb79b7674b83b>`__,
   closing `ticket 313 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/313>`__.
-  Non-DNSSEC capable backends could crash on DNSSEC queries. Fixed in
   `commit e7d023f4626a4b66f5a6f1af257a49d1444ad790 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e7d023f4626a4b66f5a6f1af257a49d1444ad790>`__ and

   (thanks to Charlie Smurthwaite) closing `ticket
   360 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/360>`__.
-  Errors looking up a UID or GID were reported confusingly ('Success'),
   fixed in `commit d0c0ae3a8d4278d63e0170e76d766ccbb3feef61 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d0c0ae3a8d4278d63e0170e76d766ccbb3feef61>`__,
   closing `ticket 359 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/359>`__.
-  Fix compilation against older MySQL, client libraries (`commit 1ee924fb3beec7307caa282191fd5b8694581be0 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/1ee924fb3beec7307caa282191fd5b8694581be0>`__,
   `commit e4e90ae1ed4b5f6c243bc82734add3d7ed56e76e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e4e90ae1ed4b5f6c243bc82734add3d7ed56e76e>`__,
   `commit 9bd88d812de7de1a984552f63a50e00b69f8f7c2 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9bd88d812de7de1a984552f63a50e00b69f8f7c2>`__),
   especially for older RHEL/CentOS. Also addresses the failure to look
   in lib64 directory for PostgreSQL.
-  Sqlite3 needs write access not just to its database file, but also to
   the directory it is in. If this wasn't the case, no useful error
   message was provided. Improvement in `commit ba71c508285eb132704f28cdfebe99e1aba4bbd7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ba71c508285eb132704f28cdfebe99e1aba4bbd7>`__.
-  Update of MongoDB backend (`commit 1eb7bc30be4a499dc1170661c07adce5ba0f261f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/1eb7bc30be4a499dc1170661c07adce5ba0f261f>`__,

-  'pdnssec hash-zone-record' emitted an inverted warning about narrow
   NSEC3 hashes. Spotted by Jan-Piet Mens, fix in `commit 5e42374ce8b94934c72b95628f2d7ce9332b17f3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5e42374ce8b94934c72b95628f2d7ce9332b17f3>`__.
-  PowerDNS can fill out default fields for SOA records, but neglected
   to do so if the SOA record was matched by an incoming ANY question.
   Spotted by Marc Laros & others. Fixes `ticket
   357 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/357>`__, code in `commit 4e9fadf6a4710fd581d2ef9d394bf54a8dc3dcc6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4e9fadf6a4710fd581d2ef9d394bf54a8dc3dcc6>`__.
-  PowerDNS would mistreat binary data in TXT records. Fix in `commit 66b40966ec45674dbd935432712510a27e2c2ce0 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/66b40966ec45674dbd935432712510a27e2c2ce0>`__.
   Again spotted by Jan-Piet Mens. Closes `ticket
   356 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/356>`__.
-  Add experimental Lua backend by our star contributor Fredrik
   Danerklint. `commit e18dbde1d496ded10aa16a79ed516ce5940e3950 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e18dbde1d496ded10aa16a79ed516ce5940e3950>`__.
-  Christoph Meerwald discovered our RRSIG freshness checking checked
   more than the intended RRSIG (on the SOA record). Fix in `commit 965f9774bca2f6ee2a487afef052e6c7283fc060 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/965f9774bca2f6ee2a487afef052e6c7283fc060>`__.
-  Christoph Meerwald discovered we got confused by TSIG signed
   EDNS-adorned queries, since we expected the EDNS OPT pseudorecord to
   be the very last record. Fix in `commit 0e4ab7bce137fce1cde6899a0f9223df0e9f45d6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0e4ab7bce137fce1cde6899a0f9223df0e9f45d6>`__.
-  Christoph Meerwald discovered that when using SOA outgoing editing we
   would sign and THEN edit. This was not productive. Fixed in `commit f33065be80bc3690791234d283b0cfb023a7b048 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f33065be80bc3690791234d283b0cfb023a7b048>`__.
-  Add missing-but-documented pdnssec command 'disable-dnssec'. Spotted
   by Craig Whitmore. Plus fixed misleading ^^help output. Code in
   `commit 5935cedec74135fb041ef5f3ae8d4e6d1e8be630 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5935cedec74135fb041ef5f3ae8d4e6d1e8be630>`__.
-  By popular demand, a tweak which makes an overloaded database no
   longer restart PowerDNS but to drop queries until the database is
   available again. Code in `commit e7e691ccdec78324a49e9bce6c0293cb456cc1ca <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e7e691ccdec78324a49e9bce6c0293cb456cc1ca>`__,
   lightly tested. Enable by setting 'overload-queue-length=100' (for
   example).
-  By suggestion of Miek Gieben of SIDN, add SOA-EDIT mode 'EPOCH' which
   sets the SOA serial number to the 'UNIX time'. Implemented in `commit d6063079d2c01a02e39bc248410f65340ff21393 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d6063079d2c01a02e39bc248410f65340ff21393>`__.
-  Added some US export control & ECCN to documentation, needed because
   of DNSSEC content. Update in `commit a9bd99f92b7504a890d24a2c8d67a6c36b0b5d6b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a9bd99f92b7504a890d24a2c8d67a6c36b0b5d6b>`__.
-  Fix up various spelling mistakes and badly formatted messages
   (`commit 4c2a2f9fc55a2ed90dabcffa2df15b5bf2d50dba <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4c2a2f9fc55a2ed90dabcffa2df15b5bf2d50dba>`__ and
   `commit 37fd87715762d0955e410abe37310942ab74124d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/37fd87715762d0955e410abe37310942ab74124d>`__) by
   Maik Zumstrull and 'anonymous'.
-  After a lot of thought, we now handle CNAMEs to names outside our
   knowledge ('bailiwick') exactly as in BIND 9.8.0, even though our way
   was standards compliant too. It confused things. Update in `commit dd7221539c181234da81e8e9e6a1023922228572 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/dd7221539c181234da81e8e9e6a1023922228572>`__ and

   Change in `commit 63c13255102e3c63b6d8fe77ef8adada854dff71 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/63c13255102e3c63b6d8fe77ef8adada854dff71>`__.
-  DNSSEC SQL schema improvements allowing for the use of constraints
   and foreign keys in `commit a101c4085435660345cb9383a5a599577952882f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a101c4085435660345cb9383a5a599577952882f>`__, by
   Gerald Gruenberg, closing `ticket
   371 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/371>`__.
-  Add support for EDNS option 'edns-subnet', based on
   draft-vandergaast-edns-client-subnet (`commit 6f97329bf84ee8bf9a9186b12f7cab639f43e8dc <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/6f97329bf84ee8bf9a9186b12f7cab639f43e8dc>`__,

-  Zone2sql sent out the wrong 'COMMIT' statement in sqlite mode. In
   addition, in this mode, zone2sql would not emit statements to update
   the domains table unless the 'slave' setting was chosen. Code in
   `commit 2241f7557d050541d820b0e46782a62846ecc676 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2241f7557d050541d820b0e46782a62846ecc676>`__.
-  We dropped the Authoritative Answer flag on an out-of-bailiwick CNAME
   referral, which was unnecessary. Code in `commit 76bf5f405e7102929da5ab07196d7b2734fbb9cb <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/76bf5f405e7102929da5ab07196d7b2734fbb9cb>`__.
-  Kees Monshouwer discovered that we failed to detect the location of
   PostgreSQL on RHEL/CentOS. Fix in `commit 4c9d3d822320513f09c254fcb447fb685051492d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4c9d3d822320513f09c254fcb447fb685051492d>`__. In

   detection of MySQL on RHEL/CentOS 64 bits systems.
-  Marc Laros re-reported an old bug in the internally used 'pdns'
   backend where details of the SOA record were not filled out
   correctly. Resolved in `commit ced6993472a48498d4e0eb4f4f62a9b30126f0de <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ced6993472a48498d4e0eb4f4f62a9b30126f0de>`__.
-  Jan-Piet Mens found that our TSIG signed SOA zone freshness check was
   signed incorrectly. Fixed in `commit 842c8dd2aae5a11ce3a2f183a63c570a16144afe <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/842c8dd2aae5a11ce3a2f183a63c570a16144afe>`__.
   Improved error messages that helped debug this issue in `commit e8b0c58e5031393ac82ecda2a305dc5ce2fada0e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e8b0c58e5031393ac82ecda2a305dc5ce2fada0e>`__,
   `commit 67672ba6a4461aba87abd11cb59f66a9f39160f2 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/67672ba6a4461aba87abd11cb59f66a9f39160f2>`__.
-  Jan-Piet Mens helped debug an issue where some servers were "almost
   always" unable to transfer a TSIG signed zone correctly. Turns out
   that the TSIG signing code used an internal timestamp and not the
   remote timestamp. Because of good NTP synchronization this quite
   often was not a problem. Fix in `commit 5b6d751ec70a502847990f06523406e01c2456dc <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5b6d751ec70a502847990f06523406e01c2456dc>`__.
-  Thor Spruyt of Telenet discovered that the PowerDNS code would try to
   emit DNS answers over TCP of over 65535 bytes long, which failed. We
   now truncate such answers properly. Code in `commit dffbaa08436a2f755d2cff9dab481a919c6c4374 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/dffbaa08436a2f755d2cff9dab481a919c6c4374>`__.
-  The Slave engine now reuses an existing database connection, removing
   the need to create a new database connection every minute (and worse,
   log about it). Code in `commit 936eb34ab50cf3463a75e551a67711fdace756d5 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/936eb34ab50cf3463a75e551a67711fdace756d5>`__.
-  Fix a potential Year 2106 bug in the TSIG signing code. Because we
   care (`commit a6e93c0f349a83b3a5e17939bb996a0c1569719a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a6e93c0f349a83b3a5e17939bb996a0c1569719a>`__).
-  Added experimental support for the 'DANE' TLSA record which is used
   to authenticate SSL certificates via DNSSEC. `commit 07dbe87ec0825a9bcb4ab11ed51376e880adc62b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/07dbe87ec0825a9bcb4ab11ed51376e880adc62b>`__.
-  Added experimental support for the MongoDB 'NoSQL' backend,
   contributed by Fredrik Danerklint in `commit eef915a2096238d1d245e2c71f3f252c8691c344 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/eef915a2096238d1d245e2c71f3f252c8691c344>`__.

   closing `ticket 231 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/231>`__.
-  Generic ODBC backend compiles again, and is reported to work for some
   users that need it. Code contributed in `ticket
   309 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/309>`__, author unknown.
-  Massively parallel slaving infrastructure, able to check the
   freshness of thousands of remote zones per second, plus perform many
   incoming zone transfers simultaneously. Sponsored by Tyler Hall, code
   in `commit 3696224df4b45d62b332117864c64092e9bb5886 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/3696224df4b45d62b332117864c64092e9bb5886>`__,

-  Core DNS logic replaced completely to deal with the brave new world
   of DNSSEC.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  sqlite2 and sqlite3 backends used MySQL-style escaping, leading to
   SQL errors in some cases. Discovered by Sten Spans. Fixed in `commit bdaab6b8d4e66d80850743fc8495f2bbb4848d64 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bdaab6b8d4e66d80850743fc8495f2bbb4848d64>`__.
-  Internal webserver no longer prints '1e2%'. Bug rediscovered by Jeff
   Sipek. Fixed in `commit bdaab6b8d4e66d80850743fc8495f2bbb4848d64 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bdaab6b8d4e66d80850743fc8495f2bbb4848d64>`__.
-  PowerDNS would refuse to serve domain names with spaces in them, or
   otherwise non-printable characters. Addressed in `commit ade8e2b8f81f49694046afe1a2302dc78f3942ab <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ade8e2b8f81f49694046afe1a2302dc78f3942ab>`__.
-  PowerDNS can now serve escaped labels, as described by RFC 4343. Data
   should be present in backends in that escaped form. Code in `commit 7ecd35765d8c7895b4eb911017d67c435d69a883 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7ecd35765d8c7895b4eb911017d67c435d69a883>`__.
-  In some cases, we would include duplicate CNAMEs. In addition, we
   would hand out a full root-referral when not configured to in some
   cases (ticket `223 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/223>`__).
   Discovered by Andreas Jakum, fixed in `commit b72687a19f328115a6b90bcecc10b16ce2c022c2 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b72687a19f328115a6b90bcecc10b16ce2c022c2>`__.
-  Shane Kerr discovered we would corrupt DNS transaction IDs from the
   packet cache on big-endian systems. Fix in `commit bb0bbdc2454749da526f72a3c393eecf7e43fe8d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bb0bbdc2454749da526f72a3c393eecf7e43fe8d>`__,
   closing `ticket 222 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/222>`__.
-  PowerDNS did not use RFC 1982 serial arithmetic, leading to a SOA
   serial number of 1 to be regarded as older than 4400000000, when in
   fact it is 'newer'. Issue (re-)discovered by Jan-Piet Mens.
-  BIND backend got confused of a zone's file name changed after a
   configuration reload. Fix in `commit 5552a8e7639e109ed62b8d4471ee34d9289fba68 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5552a8e7639e109ed62b8d4471ee34d9289fba68>`__,
   closing `ticket 228 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/228>`__.
-  When restarted by the Guardian, PowerDNS will perform a full
   multi-threaded cache cleanup, which took a long time and could crash.
   Fix in `commit 907ea90af61d792a922c6fc4001b4aced90f37e3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/907ea90af61d792a922c6fc4001b4aced90f37e3>`__.
-  Under artificial circumstances, PowerDNS would never clean its packet
   cache. Found by Marcus Goller, fix in `commit b2ac0df85cdfabf86dd4430f988499eddf2a4413 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b2ac0df85cdfabf86dd4430f988499eddf2a4413>`__ and

   update also retunes the cleanup frequency.
-  Packetcache would cache things it should not have been caching. Fixes
   in commits
   `commit e2ff25c7643dde960fd502d1a32a221c172f7899 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e2ff25c7643dde960fd502d1a32a221c172f7899>`__,

-  When processing incoming notifications, the BIND backend was
   case-sensitive, and would disregard notifications in the wrong case.
   Discovered by 'Dolphin', fix in `commit 059db45874a8606682ce2b670a002fb4941e8dee <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/059db45874a8606682ce2b670a002fb4941e8dee>`__.
-  The init.d script did not mention the 'reload' command. Code in
   `commit f22c75cd68c270a6f1b4a64e541effb38585b686 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f22c75cd68c270a6f1b4a64e541effb38585b686>`__,
   closes `ticket 233 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/233>`__.
-  Generic SQL Backends would sometimes emit obscure error messages. Fix
   in `commit e1602f7a5b0b3bb8a933b6a368e2a328599f9adb <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e1602f7a5b0b3bb8a933b6a368e2a328599f9adb>`__.
-  PowerDNS would be confused by embedded NULs in domain names, and
   would also mess up the escaping of some characters. Fix in `commit edb1c9eeb923de818bca441e0e6ad9c18b3d2c9b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/edb1c9eeb923de818bca441e0e6ad9c18b3d2c9b>`__,

-  SOA queries for the name of a delegation point were not referred. Fix
   in `commit 2893c412b7ca9bbdbbd72de4982728b277738e0f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2893c412b7ca9bbdbbd72de4982728b277738e0f>`__,
   closing `ticket 224 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/224>`__.
   In addition, queries for AAAA for a CNAMEd record pointing to a name
   with no AAAA would deliver a direct SOA, without the CNAME in
   between. Fix in `commit ca443a348e4ccca3915b9cf05e26e2a391183df7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ca443a348e4ccca3915b9cf05e26e2a391183df7>`__,

   Also, wildcard CNAMEs pointing to a record without the type requested
   suffered from the same issue, fix in `commit b3add44189d938d8a44afb55ff0ed7c1de9ecf10 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b3add44189d938d8a44afb55ff0ed7c1de9ecf10>`__.
-  On processing an incoming AXFR, once an MX or SRV record had been
   seen, all future fields got a 'priority' entry as well. This had no
   operational impact, but looked messy. Fixed in `commit 7af358fcb0c545aaa096c03a8ae0b97ef68a4eaa <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/7af358fcb0c545aaa096c03a8ae0b97ef68a4eaa>`__.
-  Aki Tuomi discovered that the BIND zone file parser would
   misrepresent 'something IN MX 15 @'. Fix in `commit 43f40013e20a100969d1cf4b7db4ce5cbacf55de <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/43f40013e20a100969d1cf4b7db4ce5cbacf55de>`__.
-  Marco Davids discovered the BIND zone file parser would trip over
   really long lines. Fix in `commit 47eb772cd13acd691849039ffe8b7ede06adb14c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/47eb772cd13acd691849039ffe8b7ede06adb14c>`__,

-  Thomas Mieslinger discovered that our webserver would only be started
   after dropping privileges, which could cause problems. Fix in `commit 96d299dbd765b0d269deebc0f4b77626242f01a1 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/96d299dbd765b0d269deebc0f4b77626242f01a1>`__.
-  Zone2sql did quite often not do exactly what was required, which
   users fixed by editing the SQL output. Revamped in `commit 1d14201415a503a42b69b193481af01bfe9a673e <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/1d14201415a503a42b69b193481af01bfe9a673e>`__.
-  An Ubuntu user discovered in Launchpad bug 600479 that restarting
   database threads cost a lot of memory. Normally this is rare, except
   in case of problems. Addressed in `commit a858f79e978b4b187bc59a672870529a4610a04c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a858f79e978b4b187bc59a672870529a4610a04c>`__.
-  BIND backend could crash under (very) high load with very large
   numbers of zones (hundreds of thousands). Fixed in `commit f1cf06785a728e0bdbb7f46895b4091a3ad1adc6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f1cf06785a728e0bdbb7f46895b4091a3ad1adc6>`__.
-  Miek Gieben and Marco Davids spotted that PowerDNS would answer the
   version.bind query in the IN class too. Bug reported via twitter! Fix
   in `commit adf13442027c74a889b354b2bb4372d27ff9ca30 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/adf13442027c74a889b354b2bb4372d27ff9ca30>`__.
-  Marcus Lauer and the OpenDNSSEC project discovered that outgoing
   notifications did not carry the 'aa' flag. Fixed in `commit 6da6416987578944d9b40651bbfec473b10f04ee <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/6da6416987578944d9b40651bbfec473b10f04ee>`__.
-  Debugging PowerDNS, or backgrounding it, could cause crashes. Fixed
   by Anders Kaseorg in `commit 440191e19f0f13d36787f8234b72b04b1e02f1aa <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/440191e19f0f13d36787f8234b72b04b1e02f1aa>`__.
-  Fixed a bug that could cause crashes on launching thousands of
   backend connections. Never observed to occur, but who knows. Fix in
   `commit 9b9ae9a8113bb9386d4179a752b73bddaee93836 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9b9ae9a8113bb9386d4179a752b73bddaee93836>`__.
-  Under some circumstances, large answers could be truncated in
   mid-record. While technically legal, this upset a number of resolver
   implementations (including the PowerDNS Recursor!). Fixed in `commit cf00d8d34d1e1e41b207c93b81757de489406861 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/cf00d8d34d1e1e41b207c93b81757de489406861>`__,
   re-closes `ticket
   200 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/200>`__.
-  Jan Piet Mens and Florian Weimer discovered we had problems dealing
   with escaped labels and escaped TXT fields. Fixed in `commit bac8f21be37b4c8f06443664f55c9717fc45cbb7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bac8f21be37b4c8f06443664f55c9717fc45cbb7>`__.
-  After 2.2 billion queries, statistics would wrap oddly. Fix in
   `commit bb3c3f50318499b09b685403c16ee9929c6104e5 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bb3c3f50318499b09b685403c16ee9929c6104e5>`__,
   closing `ticket 327 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/327>`__.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Long TXT records are now split into 255-byte components
   automatically. Implemented in `commit a6c516640aa9c4f0f98bdda2738c45dadbaa8ba6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a6c516640aa9c4f0f98bdda2738c45dadbaa8ba6>`__,

Authoritative Server version 2.9.22
-----------------------------------

**Warning**: The 2.9.22.x series of releases is end-of-life and
unsupported. It contains many issues and potential security problems. We
urge you to upgrade to a recent version of PowerDNS!

Released on the 27th of January 2009.

This is a huge release, spanning almost 20 months of development.
Besides fixing a lot of bugs, of note is the addition of the so called
'Notification Proxy', which allows PowerDNS to function as a master
server behind a firewall, plus the huge performance improvement of the
internal caches.

This work has been made possible by UPC Broadband and Directi,
respectively.

Finally, the release candidates of this version have been tested &
improved by Jorn Ekkelenkamp, Ton van Rosmalen, Jeff Sipek, Tyler Hall,
Christof Meerwald and Stefan Schmidt.

Fixed between rc1 and rc2, but not an issue in 2.9.21.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **pdns\_control ccounts** again outputs proper cache statistics.
   Implemented in `commit 4b298c7f76b0c76a4b378db7d5a05ff5da39be00 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4b298c7f76b0c76a4b378db7d5a05ff5da39be00>`__.
-  Negative query caching was reinstated, leading to 6 times fewer
   backend queries than rc1 on the Express.powerdns.com servers.
-  Packetcache no longer needlessly parses outgoing packets before
   sending them.
-  Fancy records work again. This work has been sponsored by ISP
   Services. Implemented in `commit d34d3e017f04d48338a454eeb5d9cb8cce8dee61 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d34d3e017f04d48338a454eeb5d9cb8cce8dee61>`__ and

-  IXFR queries are now supported in the sense that we treat them as
   AXFR queries, silencing warnings in other nameservers. Suggested in
   `ticket 131 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/131>`__.
-  The PIPE backend has been extended by David Apgar to allow the
   reporting of errors using the 'FAIL' command, plus support for

-  Norbert Sendetzky has added support for all record types
   supported by PowerDNS to the LDAPBackend. Furthermore, the detection
   of OpenLDAP in autoconf has been improved. Finally, debian has
   supplied some fixes to PowerLDAP. Implemented in `commit 45480ad8a7826087bc8d9ba238a60aec4d29c84c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/45480ad8a7826087bc8d9ba238a60aec4d29c84c>`__ and

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improve packet generation performance, in some cases by 25%. Code in
   `commit 16989b4c042daafcb7f04db2d22661dd67587652 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/16989b4c042daafcb7f04db2d22661dd67587652>`__,
   `commit efb265e3d802b63322542e9244430ed76de76a2c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/efb265e3d802b63322542e9244430ed76de76a2c>`__.
-  Improved access list checking performance. `commit 102eb646515217cd8870763b8596177137672e67 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/102eb646515217cd8870763b8596177137672e67>`__.
-  PowerDNS Authoritative caches were completely redone, and are now
   based on the same cache that is in the resolver. This work has been
   sponsored by Directi. In large benchmarks, PowerDNS performance has
   improved by an order of magnitude or more. This new version allows
   for near-instantaneous cache purging, plus very rapid purging based
   on suffix. Purge commands can also be batched. This work is partially
   based on an innovative reverse-string comparison function authored by
   Aki Tuomi.
-  Installations which run with very high cache hitrates can now benefit
   from multiple CPUs by setting **receiver-threads** to the number of
   desired CPUs to utilize in cache operations. Implemented in `commit d9b2581395519715447fcbbda6ba072aa0ba8a64 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d9b2581395519715447fcbbda6ba072aa0ba8a64>`__.
-  BIND backend speedups in `commit 702156dfc973632f62ee2b93422487bdb4d6d717 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/702156dfc973632f62ee2b93422487bdb4d6d717>`__,
   measured at around a 20% improvement, possibly more on very large
   setups.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Tyler Hall discovered the PowerDNS configuration file parser had
   problems with trailing tabs. This turned out to be a wider problem in
   PowerDNS. Buggy code replaced by a library call in `commit 5b2cb3be10f33854350b4c3649ae8de49d87d8cc <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5b2cb3be10f33854350b4c3649ae8de49d87d8cc>`__ and

-  David Apgar of Yahoo discovered that our 'guardian' method of
   restarting PowerDNS in case of problems was not fool proof, and
   submitted a fix. A variation of this fix can be found in `commit aced0e6c10fd22a4a72ffc562c2c0b25dbbc2883 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/aced0e6c10fd22a4a72ffc562c2c0b25dbbc2883>`__. Also
   reported by Directi.

-  The generic backends did not honour the **default-ttl** setting.
   Spotted and implemented by Matti Hiljanen.
-  Matti Hiljanen discovered that the OpenDBX backend did not fill out
   the SOA ttl value properly. Matti also improved the SQL statements
   for better compatibility. Implemented in `commit 2b266a45851eaffa287cae5e3aade783f6201cc2 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2b266a45851eaffa287cae5e3aade783f6201cc2>`__.

   waiting for new data. Addressed in
   `commit 91dd9c009e19a2d029cd01c0ca79263ac5942aef <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/91dd9c009e19a2d029cd01c0ca79263ac5942aef>`__.
-  Make singlethreaded mode more resilient against errors. `commit 5fe21f79d1f0c7c59a53501295cd87aaa22e3f61 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5fe21f79d1f0c7c59a53501295cd87aaa22e3f61>`__.
-  DNSSEC records were part of 2.9.21, but were not actually hooked up.
   Please note that while PowerDNS can serve most DNSSEC records, it
   does not do DNSSEC processing. Implemented in
   `commit 4d729b5837a1d3b8cf5724eabe986ef31c704bdd <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4d729b5837a1d3b8cf5724eabe986ef31c704bdd>`__.
-  Shawn Starr migrated all his domains to PowerDNS in one evening, from
   an installation that had been used since BIND4. In doing so, he found
   3 bugs in as many hours. An **IN** statement in the BIND
   ``named.conf`` with a zone with a trailing dot was misparsed, fixed
   in `commit 520b53575bab9c2ba70e1c8d3c5e9a910537b9da <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/520b53575bab9c2ba70e1c8d3c5e9a910537b9da>`__.
   Secondly, the zone file parser tripped over a line consisting of
   nothing but comments in the wrong place. Finally '$ORIGIN .' was
   misparsed. Last two issues fixed in `commit 4d2c97aa1715368f700a4ec389230b1eff7b0195 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4d2c97aa1715368f700a4ec389230b1eff7b0195>`__.
-  Our statistics counters did not wrap correctly after the 2.15 billion
   mark. Spotted by Stefan Schmidt, reported in `ticket
   179 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/179>`__, fixed in
   `commit dee7ba5ac1f6cf53c59da3e9652fe05ffc190097 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/dee7ba5ac1f6cf53c59da3e9652fe05ffc190097>`__.
-  Bindbackend could sometimes generate very strange error messages
   while processing a malformed zone file. Sometimes such error messages
   could cause a crash (reported on HP-UX). Addressed by `commit 87c837a3774f1997d4a4b3263a570b37890ff142 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/87c837a3774f1997d4a4b3263a570b37890ff142>`__. This
   could not be triggered remotely. Closes ticket `ticket
   203 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/203>`__.
-  Pipe backend did not clean up killed coprocesses. Found and fixed by
   Daniel Drown
-  Installations with tens of thousands of slave domains would never
   complete the cycle to check the freshness of all zones as each
   incoming notification disrupted this cycle. Addressed in cooperation
   with Tyler Hall of EditDNS.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone parser improvements mean $TTL and $INCLUDES now work a lot
   better. Implemented in
   `commit cfe397d575155a26273d13bc61fe1004dfa28e0a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/cfe397d575155a26273d13bc61fe1004dfa28e0a>`__,

-  No longer report temporary recvfrom errors, which used to spam the
   log on many systems. Addressed in `commit 21b7170d7fec509c893f7daf42b987bb6e302846 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/21b7170d7fec509c893f7daf42b987bb6e302846>`__.
-  Direct queries for 'fancy records' would lead to errors, such queries
   now fail early. Spotted by Jorn Ekkelenkamp, implemented in
   `commit c4ac58650e5c1dc7f7297ad2733ee2b0315ffa9b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c4ac58650e5c1dc7f7297ad2733ee2b0315ffa9b>`__.
-  Fix typo in geobackend, closing `ticket
   157 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/157>`__, implemented in

-  Initial work on TSIG support - not done yet. Spurred on by Marco
   Davids.
-  Embarrassingly, the 'master' configuration setting was not documented
   in the list of all settings!
-  Norbert has updated OpenDBX so that SQLite reads and writes no longer
   deadlock, plus compilation fixes on Solaris, plus the addition of
   autoserials to backends that support triggers. Implemented in `commit e830c24957c775ec577388005c604abfa66aa5db <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e830c24957c775ec577388005c604abfa66aa5db>`__.
-  Random generator is now based on AES, improving the security of
   certain proxy operations. This is the same random generator that is
   in the recursor. Implemented in `commit a28a204ace2d98152e055a05615b58967576bc9c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a28a204ace2d98152e055a05615b58967576bc9c>`__.
-  Documentation for 'supermaster' mode was improved due to popular
   demand.
-  When binding to a UDP port failed, supply a more precise error
   message (`commit 5bfabeac71fba78f17409790039f6bbe84ec4a12 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5bfabeac71fba78f17409790039f6bbe84ec4a12>`__)
-  The zone parser error messages were vastly improved, partially
   inspired by Shawn's cowboy migration. Code in `commit d27ea3946ba22e0f6606010abf2357bfa6a277c7 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d27ea3946ba22e0f6606010abf2357bfa6a277c7>`__.
-  Labels are compressed more efficiently (case-insensitively), leading
   to smaller packets. Implemented in `commit ac1db50a7cf4fdb539e6792c5098c0590773a10b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/ac1db50a7cf4fdb539e6792c5098c0590773a10b>`__.
-  Fix handling of TCP timeouts to not cause a reload of the backends.
   Implemented in `commit 8ef989633a1c6bf2a67ae25a81fb75a06bf50034 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8ef989633a1c6bf2a67ae25a81fb75a06bf50034>`__.
-  TCP Receiver no longer spams the log with common network errors.
   Implemented in `commit 0afa904954689696b2e3bcab401831f7c12114d9 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0afa904954689696b2e3bcab401831f7c12114d9>`__.
-  Move from select() to poll()-based multiplexing, allowing PowerDNS to
   listen on more than 1024 sockets simultaneously. One big PowerDNS
   user needs this. Implemented in
   `commit fab091b9e1a38822ba12e428b7f6eb62c9a20f59 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/fab091b9e1a38822ba12e428b7f6eb62c9a20f59>`__.
-  Zone2sql now reads source files in performance enhancing inode order.
   Additionally, zone2sql no longer dies on a missing zone file if
   **^^on-error-resume-next** was specified. Finally, statistics of
   zone2sql conversion have been improved. Implemented in
   `commit a19dacb93bdd215e10b42461dbbf9bbfb680b8b8 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a19dacb93bdd215e10b42461dbbf9bbfb680b8b8>`__.

-  PowerDNS can now be compiled with Boost 1.37.0.
-  Andre Lorbach of Adiscon discovered the Microsoft Windows 2003
   nameserver adds out of zone data to zone transfers, which we need to
   ignore, instead of rejecting the entire zone. Implemented in
   `commit a911c6ea292c7f1ae855a778c0c052e16ba7c202 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/a911c6ea292c7f1ae855a778c0c052e16ba7c202>`__.
-  PowerDNS now skips remote master servers which consistently generate
   timeout messages, improving the master checking cycle time
   tremendously. Developed in cooperation with Tyler Hall. Implemented
   in `commit 2f58f0ce01c5b7e682f95f90b5f8c1eaccb2c9fe <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2f58f0ce01c5b7e682f95f90b5f8c1eaccb2c9fe>`__.

-  **dnsreplay** now waits for the final answers to arrive, making it
   possible to process even small pcap files and get meaningful
   statistics. `commit 27b014bcc91450b44c4b0ea98b5d6b3e6b4c8448 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/27b014bcc91450b44c4b0ea98b5d6b3e6b4c8448>`__.
-  **dnsreplay** has a more sane default timeout now, which can be
   configured too. Suggested by Augie Schwer in `ticket
   163 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/163>`__, implemented in
   `commit 2a8fb0960d4c47ec4552be4a1f1c7f9f21202397 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2a8fb0960d4c47ec4552be4a1f1c7f9f21202397>`__.

Authoritative Server version 2.9.21.2
-------------------------------------

Released on the 18th of November 2008.

This release consists of a single patch to PowerDNS Authoritative Server
version 2.9.21.1. In some configurations, notably with configuration
option 'distributor-threads=1', the PowerDNS Authoritative Server
crashes easily in some error conditions.

All users are urged to upgrade. Even though PowerDNS restarts itself on
encountering such error conditions, and even though most PowerDNS
configurations do not run in single threaded mode, an upgrade is
recommended.

More detail can be found in `PowerDNS Security Advisory
2008-02 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2008-03.rst>`__.

Authoritative Server version 2.9.21.1
-------------------------------------

Released on the 6th of August 2008.

This release consists of a single patch to PowerDNS Authoritative Server
version 2.9.21. Brian J. Dowling of Simplicity Communications has
discovered a security implication of the previous PowerDNS behaviour to
drop queries it considers malformed. We are grateful that Brian notified
us quickly about this problem.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2008-3337. The single patch is in
`commit 8b1ed874b009aeda37843f71e6b4ec25e75485fb <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8b1ed874b009aeda37843f71e6b4ec25e75485fb>`__.
More detail can be found in `PowerDNS Security Advisory
2008-02 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2008-02.rst>`__.

The implication is that while the PowerDNS Authoritative server itself
does not face a security risk because of dropping these malformed
queries, other resolving nameservers run a higher risk of accepting
spoofed answers for domains being hosted by PowerDNS Authoritative
Servers before 2.9.21.1.

While the dropping of queries does not aid sophisticated spoofing
attempts, it does facilitate simpler attacks.

It may be good to know that several large sites already run with this
patch applied, as it has been in the public code base for some weeks
already.

PowerDNS Authoritative Server version 2.9.21
--------------------------------------------

Released the 21st of April 2007.

This is the first release the PowerDNS Authoritative Server since the
Recursor was split off to a separate product, and also marks the
transfer of the new technology developed specifically for the recursor,
back to the authoritative server.

This move has reduced the amount of code of the Authoritative server by
over 2000 lines, while improving the quality of the program enormously.

However, since so much has been changed, care should be taken when
deploying 2.9.21.

To signify the magnitude of the underlying improvements, the next
release of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server will be called 3.0.

This release would not have been possible without large amounts of help
and support from the PowerDNS Community. We specifically want to thank

Security issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The previous packet parsing and generating code contained no known
   bugs, but was however very lengthy and overly complex, and might have
   had security problems. The new code is 'inherently safe' because it
   relies on bounds-checking C++ constructs. Therefore, a move to 2.9.21
   is highly recommended.
-  Pre-2.9.21, communication between master and server nameservers was
   not checked as rigidly as possible, possibly allowing third parties
   to disrupt but not modify such communications.

**Warning**: The 'bind1' legacy version of our BIND backend has been
dropped! There should be no need to rely on this old version anymore, as
the main BIND backend has been very well tested recently.

Bugs
^^^^

-  Multi-part TXT records weren't supported. This has been fixed, and
   regression tests have been added. Code in commits
   `commit 6a5038a8526c75282e2cb1753fd457667d3d54fe <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/6a5038a8526c75282e2cb1753fd457667d3d54fe>`__,

-  Email addresses with embedded dots in SOA records were not parsed
   correctly, nor were other embedded dots. Noted by 'Bastiaan', fixed
   in `commit 38e655b657c4601b659c8ef0c96111230e663c14 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/38e655b657c4601b659c8ef0c96111230e663c14>`__.
-  BIND backend treated the 'm' TTL modifier as 'months' and not
   'minutes'. Closes Debian bug 406462. Addressed in `commit 38e655b657c4601b659c8ef0c96111230e663c14 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/38e655b657c4601b659c8ef0c96111230e663c14>`__.
-  Our snapshots were built against a static version of PostgreSQL that
   was incompatible with many Linux distributions, leading to instant
   crashes on startup. Fixed in
   `commit b45bc7bf7ceb399dfd2bcbbd7b568d8abef6154b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/b45bc7bf7ceb399dfd2bcbbd7b568d8abef6154b>`__ and
   `commit 6784bbda73f1106888be8081aa0ce2c442f9871a <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/6784bbda73f1106888be8081aa0ce2c442f9871a>`__.
-  CNAME referrals to child zones gave improper responses. Noted by
   Augie Schwer in `ticket
   123 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/123>`__, fixed in
   `commit 9493aba8c273327ce8c5d9d53eaec7efc028e3e4 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9493aba8c273327ce8c5d9d53eaec7efc028e3e4>`__.
-  When passing a port number with the **recursor** setting, this would
   sometimes generate errors during additional processing. Switched off
   overly helpful additional processing for recursive queries to remove
   this problem. Implemented in `commit 0595c0db6ac3e3a31e351842d55b09318ab7fb0f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/0595c0db6ac3e3a31e351842d55b09318ab7fb0f>`__,
   spotted by Ralf van der Enden.
-  NS to a nameserver with the name of the zone itself generated
   problems. Spotted by Augie Schwer, fixed in `commit 77235722fb74bae51f52b8911732206526b7f607 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/77235722fb74bae51f52b8911732206526b7f607>`__.
-  Multi-line records in the BIND backend were not always parsed
   correctly. Fixed in `commit 9f0076d7bc2f783799995851ecadfe6f3d7ad1fd <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9f0076d7bc2f783799995851ecadfe6f3d7ad1fd>`__.
-  The LOC-record had problems operating outside of the eastern
   hemisphere of the northern part of the world! Fixed in `commit c6a60874da55b1a591878d0b1c6a5635fb1ba730 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/c6a60874da55b1a591878d0b1c6a5635fb1ba730>`__.
-  Backends were compiled without multithreading preprocessor flags. As
   far as we can determine, this would only cause problems for the BIND
   backend, but we cannot rule out this caused instability in other
   backends. Fixed in `commit 3479a2cdd56539b9c0c96e0e55ea764f720541a3 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/3479a2cdd56539b9c0c96e0e55ea764f720541a3>`__.
-  The BIND backend was highly unstable under reloads, and leaked memory
   and file descriptors. Thanks to Mark Bergsma and Massimo Bandinelli
   for respectively pointing this out to us and testing large amounts of
   patches to fix the problem. The fixes have resulted in better
   performance, less code, and a remarkable simplification of this
   backend. Commits

   and fixed by Dan Bilik, fixed in `commit 3aa1a882c628a7aa813a458e1c062db383434f66 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/3aa1a882c628a7aa813a458e1c062db383434f66>`__.
-  Some versions of FreeBSD perform very strict checks on socket address
   sizes passed to 'connect', which could lead to problems retrieving
   zones over AXFR. Fixed in `commit 253c0df4b73620864bd1ae1a5857b0d32d567eeb <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/253c0df4b73620864bd1ae1a5857b0d32d567eeb>`__.

-  Fix crashes on the ARM processor due to alignment errors. Thanks to
   Sjoerd Simons. Closes Debian bug 397031.
-  Missing data in generic SQL backends would sometimes lead to faked
   SOA serial data. Spotted by Leander Lakkas from True. Fix in `commit 8e80db1de53a1dff6ec8f44a48dee128345e70ea <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8e80db1de53a1dff6ec8f44a48dee128345e70ea>`__.
-  When receiving two quick notifications in succession, the packet
   cache would sometimes "process" the second one, leading PowerDNS to
   ignore it. Spotted by Dan Bilik, fixed in `commit 147f6aa18ad650a8d689ca4699cb50c1569bad62 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/147f6aa18ad650a8d689ca4699cb50c1569bad62>`__.
-  Geobackend (by Mark Bergsma) did not properly override the getSOA
   method, breaking non-overlay operation of this fine backend. The
   geobackend now also skips '.hidden' configuration files, and now
   properly disregards empty configuration files. Additionally, the
   overlapping abilities were improved. Details available in `commit cf74b4e174b73f6cb847603a003f6747aaf582d6 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/cf74b4e174b73f6cb847603a003f6747aaf582d6>`__, by
   Mark.

Version 2.9.20
--------------

Released the 15th of March 2006

Besides adding OpenDBX, this release is mostly about fixing problems and
speeding up the recursor. This release has been made possible by
`XS4ALL <https://www.xs4all.nl>`__ and `True <https://true.nl>`__. Thanks!

Furthermore, we are very grateful for the help of Andrew Pinski, who
hacks on gcc, and of Joaquín M López Muñoz, the author of
`boost::multi\_index\_container <https://www.boost.org/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html>`__.
Without their near-realtime help this release would've been delayed a
lot. Thanks!

Bugs fixed in the recursor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Possible stability issues in the recursor on encountering errors
   (`commit 40207e646524bc3ed3d4b1a74fd31b1241de2102 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/40207e646524bc3ed3d4b1a74fd31b1241de2102>`__,
   `commit de1890b24e5848fee8d42d0f1dd24b99df3ac12c <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/de1890b24e5848fee8d42d0f1dd24b99df3ac12c>`__)
-  Memory leaks in recursor fixed (`commit 4c789c509c3611db124fe5a1114fd144fa5d2107 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/4c789c509c3611db124fe5a1114fd144fa5d2107>`__,
   `commit f9f05db41ef5e157172d4ecabe90f87afa2fab0b <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f9f05db41ef5e157172d4ecabe90f87afa2fab0b>`__). In a
   test 800 million real life DNS packets have been sent to the
   recursor, representing several days of traffic from a major ISP,
   memory use was high (500MB), but stable.
-  Prune all data in PowerDNS - previously per-nameserver and per-query
   performance statistics were kept around forever (`commit 8a5602d430987fbc73175c6896cfd8a40b7cb177 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/8a5602d430987fbc73175c6896cfd8a40b7cb177>`__)
-  IPv6 additional processing was broken. Reported by Lionel Elie
   Mamane, who also provided a fix. The problem was fixed differently in
   the end. `commit e29f6ed0e9f9566acf6c4302c457a65fd05000a8 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e29f6ed0e9f9566acf6c4302c457a65fd05000a8>`__.
-  pdns\_recursor did not shuffle answers since 2.9.19, leading to
   problems sending mail to the Hotmail servers. Reported in `ticket
   54 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/54>`__, fixed in `commit e67e250fa3999885da051b44340d0bd191770d78 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e67e250fa3999885da051b44340d0bd191770d78>`__.
-  If a single nameserver had multiple IP addresses listed, PowerDNS
   would only use one of them. Noted by Mark Martin, fixed in `commit bfea0d0b4d7d50d442be9084ef0779051fd3f808 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bfea0d0b4d7d50d442be9084ef0779051fd3f808>`__, who
   depends on a domain with 4 nameserver IP addresses of which 2 are
   broken.

Version 2.9.19
--------------

Released 29th of October 2005.

As with other recent releases, the usage of PowerDNS appears to have
skyrocketed. Informal, though strict, measurements show that PowerDNS
now powers around 50% of all German domains, and somewhere in the order
of 10-15% of the rest of the world. Furthermore, DNS is set to take a
central role in connecting Voice over IP providers, with PowerDNS
offering a very good feature set for these ENUM deployments. PowerDNS is
already powering the E164.info ENUM zone and also acts as the backend
for a major VoIP provisioning platform.

Included in this release is the now complete packet parsing/generating,
record parsing/generating infrastructure. Furthermore, this framework is
used by the recursor, hopefully making it very fast, memory efficient
and robust. Many records are now processed using a single line of code.
This has made the recursor a lot stricter in packet parsing, you will
see some error messages which did not appear before. Rest assured
however that these only happen for queries which have no valid answer in
any case.

Furthermore, support for DNSSEC records is available in the new
infrastructure, although is should be emphasised that there is more to
DNSSEC than parsing records. There is no real support for DNSSEC (yet).

Additionally, the BIND Backend has been replaced by what was up to now
known as the 'Bind2Backend'. Initial benchmarking appears to show that
this backend is faster, uses less memory and has shorter startup times.
The code is also shorter.

This release fixes a number of embarrassing bugs and is a recommended
upgrade.

Thanks are due to `XS4ALL <https://www.xs4all.nl>`__ who are supporting
continuing development of PowerDNS, the fruits of which can be found in
this release already. Furthermore, a remarkable number of people have
helped report bugs, validate solutions or have submitted entire patches.
Many thanks!

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  dnsreplay now has a help message and has received further massive
   updates, making the code substantially faster. It turns out that
   dnsreplay is often 'heavier' than the PowerDNS process being
   benchmarked.
-  PowerDNS recursor no longer prints out its queries by default as most
   recursor deployments have too much traffic for this to be useful.
-  PowerDNS recursor is now able to read its root-hints from disk, which
   is useful to operate with alternate roots, like the `Open Root Server
   Network <https://www.orsn.org>`__. See `PowerDNS
   Recursor <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/>`__.
-  PowerDNS can now send out old-fashioned root-referrals when queried
   for domains for which it is not authoritative. Wastes some bandwidth
   but may solve incoming query floods if domains are delegated to you
   for which you are not authoritative, but which are queried by broken
   recursors.
-  PowerDNS now prints out a warning when running with legacy
   LinuxThreads implementation instead of the high performance NPTL
   library. `commit 2b4d0a490fd39a1018135f42a669f35559f858d8 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/2b4d0a490fd39a1018135f42a669f35559f858d8>`__.
-  A lot of superfluous calls to gettimeofday() have been removed,
   making PowerDNS and especially the recursor faster. Suggested by Kai.
-  SPF records are now supported natively. `commit dd10362105be43185aa0e6c959d27e3eccc1e60d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/dd10362105be43185aa0e6c959d27e3eccc1e60d>`__,
   closing `ticket 22 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/22>`__.
-  Improved IPv6 'bound to' messages. Thanks to Niels Bakker, Wichert
   Akkerman and Gerty de Wolf for suggestions.
-  Separate graphs can now be made of IPv6 queries and answers. `commit bd852e59a9606389b5ed355bdc19c4b042eccd58 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/bd852e59a9606389b5ed355bdc19c4b042eccd58>`__.
-  Out of zone additional processing is now on by default to better
   comply with standards. `commit 9054d8a46ff923ec9c6dd0ae2831704136987baf <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9054d8a46ff923ec9c6dd0ae2831704136987baf>`__.
-  Regression tests have been expanded to deal with more record types
   (SRV, NAPTR, TXT, duplicate SRV).
-  Improved query-logging in Bindbackend, which can be used for
   debugging purposes.
-  Dropped libpcap dependency, making compilation easier
-  pdns\_control now has a help message.
-  Add RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS and NSEC records for DNSSEC-bis to new parser
   infrastructure.
-  Recursor now honours EDNS0 allowing it to send out larger answers.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Domain name validation has been made a lot stricter - it turns out
   PostgreSQL was interpreting some (corrupt) domain names as unicode.
   Tested and suggested by Register.com (`commit 5158c49503e6902c2b0b70a8f87a891b7ce94f74 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5158c49503e6902c2b0b70a8f87a891b7ce94f74>`__).

   closing Debian bug 330184.
-  Recent g++ versions exposed a mistake in the PowerDNS recursor cache
   pruning code, causing random crashes. Fixed in `commit d25b35e27d909824b2f8d97da1f99b16c3f60e67 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/d25b35e27d909824b2f8d97da1f99b16c3f60e67>`__.
   Reported by several Red Hat users.
-  PowerDNS recursor, and MTasker in general, did not work on Solaris.

-  Bindbackend2 did not properly search its include path for $INCLUDE
   statements. Noted by Mark Bergsma, `commit 5b15d4d308a4fca1692edc8754f209b17dc9b05f <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/5b15d4d308a4fca1692edc8754f209b17dc9b05f>`__.
-  Bindbackend did not notice changed zones, this problem has been fixed
   by the move to Bind2.
-  Pipebackend did not clean up, leading to an additional pipe backend
   per AXFR or pdns\_control reload. Discovered by Marc Jauvin, fixed by
   `commit f7a23c1c5dbdecd587d933f54386ba55ee489f6d <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f7a23c1c5dbdecd587d933f54386ba55ee489f6d>`__.
-  Bindbackend (both old and current versions) did not honour 'include'
   statements in ``named.conf`` on **pdns\_control rediscover**. Noted
   by Marc Jauvin, fixed by `commit 751f7add980af4902823e9dda354c5e6392f8f45 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/751f7add980af4902823e9dda354c5e6392f8f45>`__.
-  Zone transfers were sometimes shuffled, which wastes useless time,
   `commit e9dd48f9018ef291849c881d88faa66baab5c592 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/e9dd48f9018ef291849c881d88faa66baab5c592>`__.
-  CNAMEs and Wildcards now work as in Bind, fixing many complaints,
   `commit 9054d8a46ff923ec9c6dd0ae2831704136987baf <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/9054d8a46ff923ec9c6dd0ae2831704136987baf>`__.
-  NAPTR records were compressed, which would work, but was in violation
   of the RFC, commit 493.
-  NAPTR records were not always parsed correctly from BIND zone files,
   fixed, commit 494.
-  Geobackend needed additional include statement to compile on more
   recent Linux distributions, commit 496.

Version 2.9.18
--------------

Released on the 16th of July 2005.

The '8 million domains' release, which also marks the battle readiness
of the PowerDNS Recursor. The latest improvements have been made
possible by financial support and contributions by
`Register.com <https://register.com>`__ and
`XS4ALL <https://www.xs4all.nl/>`__. Thanks!

This release brings a number of new features (vastly improved recursor,
Generic Oracle Support, DNS analysis and replay tools, and more) but
also has a new build dependency, the `Boost
library <https://www.boost.org>`__ (version 1.31 or higher).

Currently several big ISPs are evaluating the PowerDNS recursor for
their resolving needs, some of them have switched already. In the course
of testing, over 350 million actual queries have been recorded and
replayed, the answers turn out to be satisfactorily.

This testing has verified that the pdns recursor, as shipped in this
release, can stand up to heavy duty ISP loads (over 20000
queries/second) and in fact does so better than major other nameservers,
giving more complete answers and being faster to boot.

We invited ISPs who noted recursor problems to record their problematic
traffic and replay it using the tools described in "Tools to analyse DNS
traffic" to discover if PowerDNS did a better
job, and to let us know the results.

Additionally, the bind2backend is almost ready to replace the stock bind
backend. If you run with Bind zones, you are cordially invited to
substitute ``launch=bind2`` for ``launch=bind``. This will happen
automatically in 2.9.19!

In other news, the entire Wikipedia constellation now runs on PowerDNS
using the Geo Backend! Thanks to Mark Bergsma for keeping us updated.

There are two bugs with security implications, which only apply to
installations running with the LDAP backend, or installations providing
recursion to a limited range of IP addresses. If any of these apply to
you, an upgrade is highly advised

-  The LDAP backend did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to
   fail and not answer questions. We have not investigated further risks
   involved, but we advise LDAP users to update as quickly as possible
   (Norbert Sendetzky, Jan de Groot)
-  Questions from clients denied recursion could blank out answers to
   clients who are allowed recursion services, temporarily. Reported by
   Wilco Baan. This would've made it possible for outsiders to blank out
   a domain temporarily to your users. Luckily PowerDNS would send out
   SERVFAIL or Refused, and not a denial of a domain's existence.

General bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  TCP authoritative server would not relaunch a backend after failure
   (reported by Norbert Sendetzky)
-  Fix backend restarting logic (reported, and fix suggested by Norbert
   Sendetzky)
-  Launching identical backends multiple times, with different settings,
   did not work. Reported by Mario Manno.
-  Master/slave queries did not honour the **query-local-address**
   setting. Spotted by David Levy of Register.com. The fix also
   randomises the local port used, slightly improving security.

Compilation fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix compile on Solaris, they define 'PC' for some reason. Reported by
   Eric Yiu.
-  PowerDNS recursor would not compile on FreeBSD due to Linux specific
   defines, as reported in cvstrac ticket 26 (Ralf van der Enden)
-  Several 64 bits issues have been fixed, especially in the Logging
   subsystem.
-  SSQLite would fail to compile on recent Debian systems (Matthijs
   Möhlmann)
-  Generic MySQL would not compile on 64-bit platforms.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS now reports stray command line arguments, like when running
   '^^local-port 5300' instead of '^^local-port=5300'. Reported by
   Christian Welzel.
-  We now warn against erroneous logging-facility specification, ie
   specifying an unknown facility.
-  **^^version** now outputs gcc version used, so we can tell people
   2.95 is no longer supported.
-  Extended regression tests, moved them to the new 'sdig' tool (see
   below).
-  Bind2backend is now blazingly fast, and highly memory efficient to
   boot. As a special bonus it can read gzipped zones directly. The
   '.NET' zone is hosted using 401MB of memory, the same size as the
   zone on disk.
-  The Pipe Backend has been improved such that it can send out
   different answers based on the IP address the question was received
   ON. See `PipeBackend
   protocol <../backends/pipe.rst#pipebackend-protocol>`__ for
   how this changed the Pipe Backend protocol. Note that you need to set
   **pipebackend-abi-version** to benefit from this change, existing
   clients are not affected. Change and documentation contributed by
   Marc Jauvin of Register4Less.
-  LDAP backend has been updated (Norbert Sendetzky).

Recursor improvements and fixes.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__ for details. The changes
below mean that all of the caveats listed for the recursor have now been
addressed.

-  After half an hour of uptime, the entire cache would be pruned for
   each packet, which is a tad slow. It now appears the pdns recursor is
   among the fastest around.
-  Under high loads, or when unlucky, some query mthreads would get
   'stuck', and show up in the statistics as eternally running queries.
-  Lots of redundant gettimeofday() and time() calls were removed, which
   has resulted in a measurable speedup.
-  pdns\_recursor can now listen on several addresses simultaneously.
-  Now supports setuid and setgid operation to allow running as a less
   privileged user (Bram Vandoren).
-  Return code of pdns\_recursor binary did not make sense (Matthijs
   Möhlmann and Thomas Hood)
-  Timeouts and errors are now split out in statistics.
-  Many people reported broken statistics, it turned out that no
   statistics were being reported if there had been no questions to base
   them on. We now log a message to that effect.
-  Add **query-local-address** support, which allows the recursor to
   send questions from a specific IP address. Useful for anycast setups.
-  Add outgoing TCP query support and proper truncated answer support.
   Needed for Worldnic Denial of Service protection, which sends out
   truncated packets to force clients to connect over TCP, which
   prevents spoofing.
-  Properly truncate our own answers.
-  Improve our TCP answers by using writev, which is slightly friendlier
   to the network.
-  On FreeBSD, TCP errors could cause the recursor to exit suddenly due
   to a SIGPIPE signal.
-  Maximum number of simultaneous client TCP connections can now be
   limited with the **max-tcp-clients** setting.
-  Add aggressive timeouts for TCP clients to make sure resources are
   not wasted. Defaults to two seconds, can be configured with the
   **client-tcp-timeout** setting.

Backend fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  SQLite backend would not slave properly (Darron Broad)
-  Generic MySQL would not compile on 64-bit platforms.

New technology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Added the new DNS parser logic, called MOADNSParser. Completely
   modular, every memory access checked.
-  'sdig', a simple dig work-alike with 'canonical' output, which is
   used for the regression tests. Based on the new DNS parser logic.
-  **dnswasher**, **dnsreplay** and **dnsscope**, all DNS analysis
   tools.
-  Generic Oracle Backend, sponsored by Register.COM.

Version 2.9.17
--------------

See `the new timeline <http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/timeline>`__ for
progress reports.

The 'million domains' release - PowerDNS has now firmly established
itself as a major player with the unofficial count (ie, guesswork) now
at over two million PowerDNS domains! Also, the GeoBackend has been
tested by a big website and may soon see wider deployment. Thanks to
Mark Bergsma for spreading the word!

It is also a release with lots of changes and fixes. Take care when
deploying!

Security issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS could be temporarily DoSed using a random stream of bytes.
   Reported cause of this has been fixed.

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Reported version can be changed, or removed - see the
   "version-string" setting.
-  Duplicate MX records are now no longer considered duplicate if their
   priorities differ. Some people need this feature for spam filtering.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

-  NAPTR records can now be slaved, patch by Lorens Kockum.
-  GMySQL now works on Solaris
-  PowerDNS could be confused by questions with a %-sign in them -
   fixing cvstrac ticket #16 (reported by dilinger at voxel.net)
-  An authentication bug in the webserver was possibly fixed, please
   report if you were suffering from this. Being unable to authenticate
   to the webserver was what you would've noticed.
-  Fix for cvstrac ticket #2, PowerDNS could lose sync when sending out
   a very large number of notifications. Excellent bug report by Martin
   Hoffman, who also improved our original bugfix.
-  Fix the oldest PowerDNS bug in existence - under some circumstances,
   PowerDNS would log to syslog one character at a time. This was
   cvstrac ticket #4
-  HINFO records can now be slaved, fixing cvstrac ticket #8.
-  pdns\_recursor could block under some circumstances, especially in
   case of corrupt UDP packets. Reported by Wichert Akkerman. Fix by
   Christopher Meer. This was cvstrac ticket #13.
-  Large SOA serial numbers would sometimes be logged as a signed
   integer, leading to negative numbers in the log.
-  PowerDNS now fully supports 32 bit SOA serial numbers (thanks to Mark
   Bergsma), closing cvstrac ticket #5.
-  pdns\_recursor ^^local-address help text was wrong.
-  Very devious bug - PowerDNS did not clear its cache before sending
   out update notifications, leading slaves to conclude there was no
   update to AXFR. Excellent debugging by mkuchar at wproduction.cz.
-  Probably fixed cvstrac ticket #26, which caused pdns\_recursor to
   fail on recent FreeBSD 5.3 systems. Please check, I have no such
   system to test on.
-  Geobackend did not get built for Debian.

Version 2.9.16
--------------

The 'it must still be Friday somewhere' release. Massive number of
fixes, portability improvements and the new Geobackend by Mark Bergsma &
friends.

New
^^^

-  The Geobackend which makes it possible to send different answers to
   different IP ranges. Initial documentation can be found in
   pdns/modules/geobackend/README.
-  qgen query generation tool. Nearly completely undocumented and hard
   to build too, it requires Boost. But very spiffy. Use **cd pdns; make
   qgen** to build it.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

-  The most reported bug ever was fixed. Zone2sql required the inclusion
   of unistd.h, except on Debian unstable.
-  PowerDNS tried to listen on its control "pipe" which does not work.
   Probably harmless, but might have caused some oddities.
-  The Packet Cache did not always set its TTL immediately, causing some
   packets to be inserted, even when running with the cache disabled
   (Mark Bergsma).
-  Valgrind found some uninitialized reads, causing bogus values in the
   priority field when it was not needed.
-  Valgrind found a bug in MTasker where we used delete instead of
   delete[].
-  SOA serials and other parameters are unsigned. This means that very
   large SOA serial numbers would be messed up (Michel Stol, Stefano
   Straus)
-  PowerDNS left its controlsocket around after exit and reported
   confusing errors if a socket was already in use.
-  The recursor proxy did not work on big-endian systems like SPARC and
   some MIPS processors (Remco Post)
-  We no longer dump core on processing LOC records on UltraSPARC
   (Andrew Mulholland supplied a testing machine)

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  MySQL can now connect to a specified port again (Chris Anderton).
-  When running chroot()ed and with master or slave support active,
   PowerDNS needs to resolve domain names to find slaves. This in turn
   may require access to certain libraries. Previously, these needed to
   be available in the chroot directory but by forcing an initial
   lookup, these libraries are now loaded before the chrooting.
-  pdns\_recursor was very slow after having done a larger number of
   queries because of the checks to see if a query should be throttled.
   This is now done using a set which is a lot faster than the previous
   full sequential scan.
-  The throttling code may not have throttled as much as was configured.
-  Yet another big LDAP update. The LDAP backend now load balances
   connections over several hosts (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  Updated b.root-servers.net address in the recursor

Version 2.9.15
--------------

This release fixes up some of the shortcomings in 2.9.14, and adds some
new features too.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

-  **allow-recursion-override** was on by default, it was meant to be
   off.
-  Logging was still off in daemon mode, fixed.
-  debian/rules forgot to build an sqlite package
-  Recursor accidentally linked in MySQL - this was the result of an
   experiment with a persistent recursor cache.
-  The PowerDNS recursor had stability problems. It now sorts
   nameservers (roughly) by responsiveness. The 'roughly' part upset the
   sorting algorithm used, the speeds being sorted on changed during
   sorting.
-  The recursor now outputs the nameserver average response times in
   trace mode
-  LDAP compiles again.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  zone2sql can now accept ``-`` as a file name which causes it to read
   stdin. This allows the following to work: **dig axfr example.org \|
   zone2sql ^^gmysql ^^zone=- \| mysql pdns**, which is a nice way to
   import a zone.
-  zone2sql now ignores duplicate SOA records which are identical -
   which also makes the above possible.
-  Remove libpqpp dependencies - since we now use the native C API for
   PostgreSQL

Version 2.9.14
--------------

Big release with the fix for the all important 2^30 seconds problem and
a lot of other news. - errno problems would cause compilation problems
when using LDAP (Norbert Sendetzky) - The Generic SQL backend could
cause crashes on PostgreSQL when using pdns\_control notify (Georg
Bauer) - Debian compatible init.d script (Wichert Akkerman) - If using
the master or slave features, pdns had the notion of eternity ending in
2038, except that due to a thinko, eternity ended out to be the 10th of
January 2004. This caused a loop to timeout immediately. Many thanks to
Jasper Spaans for spotting the bug within five minutes. - Parts of the
SOA field were not canonicalized. - The loglevel could in fact cause
nothing to be logged (Norbert Sendetzky)

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The recursor now chooses the fastest nameserver, which causes a big
   speedup!
-  LDAP now has different lookup models
-  Cleanups, better load distribution, better exception handling,
   zone2ldap improvements
-  The recursor was somewhat chatty about TCP connections
-  PostgreSQL now only depends on the C API and not on the deprecated
   C++ one
-  PowerDNS can now fully overrule external zones when doing recursion.
   See `Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__.

Version 2.9.13
--------------

Big news! Windows is back! Our great friend Michel Stol found the time
to update the PowerDNS code so it works again under windows.

Furthermore, big thanks go out to Dell who quickly repaired my trusty
`laptop <https://berthub.eu/dell-d800>`__.

His changes - Generic SQLite support added - Removed the ODBC backend,
replaced it by the Generic ODBC Backend, which has all the cool
configurability of the Generic MySQL and PostgreSQL backends. - The
PowerDNS Recursor now runs as a Service. It defaults to running on port
5300, PowerDNS itself is configured to expect the Recursor on port 5300
now. - The PowerDNS Service is now known as 'PowerDNS' to Windows. - The
Installer was redone, this time with `NSIS2 <https://nsis.sourceforge.io/>`__. -
General updates and fixes.

Other news
^^^^^^^^^^

**Note**: There appears to be a problem with PowerDNS on Red Hat 7.3
with GCC 2.96 and self-compiled binaries. The symptoms are that PowerDNS
works on the foreground but fails as a daemon. We're working on it.

If you do note problems, let the list know, if you don't, please do so
as well. Tell us if you use the RPM or compiled yourself.

It is known that not compiling in MySQL support helps solve the problem,
but then you don't have MySQL.

There have been a number of reports on MySQL connections being dropped
on FreeBSD 4.x, which sometimes causes PowerDNS to give up and reload
itself. To combat this, MySQL error messages have been improved in some
places in hopes of figuring out what is up. The initial indication is
that MySQL itself sometimes terminates the connection and, amazingly,
that switching to a Unix domain socket instead of TCP solves the
problem.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

-  **allow-axfr-ips** did not work for individual IP addresses (bug &
   fix by Norbert Sendetzky)

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Opteron support! Thanks to Jeff Davey for providing a shell on an
   Opteron. The fixes should also help PowerDNS on other platforms with
   a 64 bit userspace.

   Btw, the PowerDNS team has a strong desire for an Opteron :-)

-  pdns\_recursor jumbles answers now. This means that you can do poor
   man's round robin by supplying multiple A, MX or AAAA records for a
   service, and get a random one on top each time. Interestingly, this
   feature appeared out of nowhere, this change was made to the
   authoritative code but due to the wonders of code-reuse had an effect
   on pdns\_recursor too.
-  Big LDAP cleanup. Support for TLS was added. Zone2LDAP also gained
   the ability to generate ldif files containing a tree or a list of
   entries. (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  Zone2sql is now somewhat clearer when reporting malformed line errors
   - it did not always include the name of the file causing a problem,
   especially for big installations. Problem noted by Thom May.
-  pdns\_recursor now survives the expiration of all its root records,
   most often caused by prolonged disconnection from the net.

Version 2.9.12
--------------

Release rich in features. Work on Verisign oddities, addition of SQLite
backend, pdns\_recursor maturity.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ^^version command (requested by Mike Benoit)
-  delegation-only, a Verisign special.
-  Generic `SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org>`__ support, by Michel 'Who da
   man?' Stol. See `Generic SQLite
   backend <../backends/generic-sqlite3.rst>`__.
-  init.d script for pdns\_recursor
-  Recursor now actually purges its cache, saving memory.
-  Slave configuration now no longer falls over when presented with a
   NULL master
-  Bindbackend2 now has supermaster support (Mark Bergsma, untested)
-  Answers are now shuffled! It turns out a few recursors don't do
   shuffling (pdns\_recursor, djbdns), so we do it now. Requested by
   Jorn Ekkelenkamp of ISP-Services. This means that if you have
   multiple IP addresses for one host, they will be returned in
   differing order every once in a while.

Bugs
^^^^

-  0.0.0.0/0 didn't use to work (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  pdns\_recursor would try to resolve IP address which to bind to,
   potentially causing chicken/egg problem
-  gpgsql no longer reports as gmysql (Sherwin Daganoto)
-  SRV would not be parsed right from disk (Christof Meerwald)
-  An AXFR from a zone hosted on the LDAP backend no longer transmits
   all the reverse entries too (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  PostgreSQL backend now does error checking. It would be a bit too
   trusting before.

Improvements, cleanups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS now reports the numerical IP addresses it binds to instead
   of the, possibly, alphanumeric names the operator passed.
-  Removed only-soa hackery (noticed by Norbert Sendetzky)
-  Debian packaging fixes (Wichert Akkerman)
-  Some parameter descriptions were improved.
-  Cleanups by Norbert: getAuth moved to chopOff, arguments::contains
   massive cleanup, more.

Version 2.9.11
--------------

Yet another iteration, hopefully this will be the last silly release.

**Warning**: There has been a change in behaviour whereby
**disable-axfr** does what it means now! From now on, setting
**allow-axfr-ips** automatically disables AXFR from unmentioned subnets.

This release enables AXFR again, **disable-axfr** did the opposite of
what it claimed. Furthermore, the pdns\_recursor now cleans its cache,
which should save some memory in the long run. Norbert contributed some
small LDAP work which should come in useful in the future.

Version 2.9.10
--------------

Small bugfixes, LDAP update. Released 3rd of July 2003. Apologies for
the long delay, real life keeps interfering.

**Warning**: Do not use or try to use 2.9.9, it was a botched release!

**Warning**: There has been a change in behaviour whereby
**disable-axfr** does what it means now! From now on, setting
**allow-axfr-ips** automatically disables AXFR from unmentioned subnets.

-  2.9.8 was prone to crash on adding additional records. Thanks to
   excellent debugging by PowerDNS users worldwide, the bug was found
   quickly and is in fact present in all earlier PowerDNS releases, but
   for some reason doesn't cause crashes there.
-  Notifications now jump in front of the queue of domains that need to
   be checked for changes, giving much greater perceived performance.
   This is needed if you have tens of thousands of slave domains and
   your master server is on a high latency link. Thanks to Mark Jeftovic
   of EasyDNS for suggesting this change and testing it on their
   platform.
-  Dean Mills reported that PowerDNS does confusing logging about
   changing GIDs and UIDs, fixed. Cosmetic only.
-  pdns\_recursor may have logged empty lines for some users, fixed.
   Solution suggested by Norbert Sendetzky.
-  LDAP: DNS TTLs were random values (Norbert Sendetzky, Stefan
   Pfetzing). New **ldap-default-ttl** option.
-  LDAP: Now works with OpenLDAP 2.1 (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  LDAP: error handling for invalid MX records implemented (Norbert
   Sendetzky)
-  LDAP: better exception handling (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  LDAP: code cleanup of lookup() (Norbert Sendetzky)
-  LDAP: added support for scoped searches (Norbert Sendetzky)

Version 2.9.8
-------------

Queen's day release! 30th of April 2003.

Added support for AIX, fixed negative SOA caching. Some other cleanups.
Not a major release but enough reasons to upgrade.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Recursor had problems expiring negatively cached entries, which
   wasted memory and also led to the continued non-existence of hosts
   that since had come into existence.
-  The Generic SQL backends did not lowercase the names of records,
   which led to new records not being found by case-sensitive databases
   (notably PostgreSQL). Found by Volker Goetz.
-  NS queries for zones for which we did not carry authority, but only
   had delegation information, had their NS records in the wrong
   section. Minor detail, but a standards violation nonetheless. Spotted
   by Stephane Bortzmeyer.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Removed crypt.h dependency from powerldap.hh, which was a problem on
   some platforms (Richard Arends)
-  PowerDNS can't parse so called binary labels which we now detect and
   ignore, after printing a warning.
-  Specifying allow-axfr-ips now automatically disables AXFR for all
   non-mentioned addresses.
-  A Solaris ready init.d script is now part of the tar.gz (contributed,
   but I lost by whom).
-  Added some fixes to PowerDNS can work on AIX (spotted by Markus
   Heimhilcher).
-  Norbert Sendetzky contributed ``zone2ldap``.
-  Everybody's favorite compiler warning from ``zone2sql.cc`` was
   removed!
-  Recursor now listens on TCP!

Version 2.9.7
-------------

Released on 2003-03-20.

This is a sweeping release in the sense of cleanup. There are some new
features but mostly a lot of cleanup going on. Hiding inside is the
``bind2backend``, the next generation of the bind backend. A work in
progress. Those of you with overlapping zones, as mentioned in the
changelog of 2.9.6, are invited to check it out by replacing
**launch=bind** by **launch=bind2** and renaming all **bind-**
parameters to **bind2-**. Be aware that if you run with many small
zones, this backend is faster, but if you run with a few large ones, it
is slower. This will improve.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  Mark Bergsma contributed **query-local-address** which allows the
   operator to select which source address to use. This is useful on
   servers with multiple source addresses and the operating system
   selecting an unintended one, leading to remotes denying access.
-  PowerDNS can now perform AAAA additional processing optionally,
   turned on by setting **do-ipv6-additional-processing**. Thanks to
   Stephane Bortzmeyer for pointing out the need.
-  Bind2backend, which is almost in compliance with the new IETF
   AXFR-clarify (some would say 'redefinition') draft. This backend is
   not ready for primetime but you may want to try it if you currently
   have overlapping zones and note problems. An overlapping zone would
   be having "ipv6.powerdns.com" and "powerdns.com" zones on one server.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone2sql would happily try to read from a directory and not give a
   useful error about this.
-  PowerDNS now reports the case where it can't figure out any IP
   address of slave nameservers for a zone
-  Removed **receiver-threads** setting which was experimental and in
   fact only made things worse.
-  LDAP backend updates from its author Norbert Sendetzky. Reverse
   lookups should work now too.
-  An error message about unparsable packets did not include the
   originating IP address (fixed by Mark Bergsma)
-  PowerDNS can now be started via path resolution while running with a
   guardian. Suggested by Maurice Nonnekes.
-  ``pdns_recursor`` moved to ``sbin`` (reported by Norbert Sendetzky)
-  Retuned some logger errorlevels, a lot of master/slave chatter was
   logged as 'Error'. Reported by Willem de Groot.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``zone2sql`` did not remove trailing dots in SOA records.
-  ldapbackend did not include ``utility.hh`` which caused compilation
   problems on Solaris (reported by Remco Post)
-  ``pdns_control`` could leave behind remnants in case PowerDNS was not
   running (reported by dG)
-  Incoming AXFR did not work on Solaris and other big-endian systems
   (Willem de Groot helped debugging this long-standing problem).
-  Recursor could crash on convoluted CNAME loops. Thanks to Dan Faerch
   for delivering core dumps.
-  Silly 'wuh' debugging output in zone2sql and bindbackend removed
   (spotted by Ivo van der Wijk).
-  Recursor neglected to differentiate between negative cache of
   NXDOMAIN and NOERROR, leading to problems with IPv6 enabled Windows
   clients. Thanks to Stuart Walsh for reporting this and testing the
   fix.
-  PowerDNS set the 'aa' bit on serving NS records in a zone for which
   it was authoritative. Most implementations drop the 'aa' bit in this
   case and Stephane Bortzmeyer informed us of this. PowerDNS now also
   drops the 'aa' bit in this case.
-  The webserver tended to fail after prolonged operation on FreeBSD,
   this was due to an uninitialised timeout, other platforms were lucky.
   Thanks to G.P. de Boer for helping debug this.
-  getAnswers() in dnspacket.cc could be forced to read bytes beyond the
   end of the packet, leading to crashes in the PowerDNS recursor. This
   is an ongoing project that needs more work. Reported by Dan Faerch,
   with a core dump proving the problem.

Version 2.9.6
-------------

Two new backends - Generic ODBC (windows only) and LDAP. Furthermore, a
few important bugs have been fixed which may have hampered sites seeing
a lot of outgoing zone transfers. Additionally, the pdns recursor now
has 'query throttling' which is pretty cool. In short this makes sure
that PowerDNS does not send out heaps of queries if a nameserver is
unable to provide an answer. Many operators of authoritative setups are
all too aware of recursing nameservers that hammer them for zones they
don't have, PowerDNS won't do that anymore now, no matter what clients
request of it.

**Warning**: There is an unresolved issue with the BIND backend and
'overlapping' slave zones. So if you have 'example.com' and also have a
separate slave zone called 'external.example.com', things may go wrong
badly. Thanks to Christian Laursen for working with us a lot in finding
this issue. We hope to resolve it soon.

-  BIND Backend now honours notifies, code to support this was
   accidentally left out. Thanks to Christian Laursen for noticing this.
-  Massive speedup for those of you using the slightly deprecated MBOXFW
   records. Thanks to Jorn of `ISP
   Services <http://www.ISP-Services.nl>`__ for helping and testing this
   improvement.
-  $GENERATE had an off-by-one bug where it would omit the last record
   to be generated (Christian Laursen)
-  Simultaneous AXFRs may have been problematic on some backends. Thanks
   to Jorn of ISP-Services again for helping us resolve this issue.
-  Added LDAP backend by Norbert Sendetzky, see `LDAP
   Backend <../backends/ldap.rst>`__.
-  Added Generic ODBC backend for Windows by Michel Stol.
-  Simplified 'out of zone data' detection in incoming AXFR support,
   hopefully removing a case sensitivity bug there. Thanks again to
   Christian Laursen for reporting this issue.
-  $include in-zonefile was broken under some circumstances, losing the
   last character of a file name. Thanks to Joris Vandalon for noticing
   this.
-  The zone parser was more case-sensitive than BIND, refusing to accept
   'in' as well as 'IN'. Thanks to Joris Vandalon for noticing this.

Version 2.9.5
-------------

Released on 2002-02-03.

This version is almost entirely about recursion with major changes to
both the pdns recursor, which is renamed to '``pdns_recursor``' and to
the main PowerDNS binary to make it interact better with the recursing
component.

Sadly, due to `technical
reasons <https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2003-01/msg00245.html>`__,
compiling the pdns recursor and pdns authoritative nameserver into one
binary is not immediately possible. During the release of 2.9.4 we
stated that the recursing nameserver would be integrated in the next
release - this won't happen now.

However, this turns out to not be that bad at all. The recursor can now
be restarted without having to restart the rest of the nameserver, for
example. Cooperation between the both halves of PowerDNS is also almost
seamless. As a result, 'non-lazy recursion' has been dropped. See
`Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__ for more details.

Furthermore, the recursor only works on Linux, Windows and Solaris (not
entirely). FreeBSD does not support the required functions. If you know
any important FreeBSD people, plea with them to support
set/get/swapcontext! Alternatively, FreeBSD coders could read the
solution presented here `in figure
5 <https://evanjones.ca/software/threading.html>`__.

The 'Contributor of the Month' award goes to Mark Bergsma who has
responded to our plea for help with the label compressor and contributed
a wonderfully simple and right fix that allows PowerDNS to compress just
as well as other nameservers out there. An honorary mention goes to Ueli
Heuer who, despite having no C++ experience, submitted an excellent SRV
record implementation.

Excellent work was also performed by Michel Stol, the Windows guy, in
fixing all our non-portable stuff again. Christof Meerwald has also done
wonderful work in porting MTasker to Windows, which was then used by
Michel to get the recursor functioning on Windows.

Other changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  dnspacket.cc was cleaned up by factoring out common operations
-  Heaps of work on the recursing nameserver. Has now achieved *days* of
   uptime!
-  Recursor renamed from syncres to ``pdns_recursor``
-  PowerDNS can now serve records it does not know about. To benefit
   from this slightly undocumented feature, add 1024 to the numerical
   type of a record and include the record in binary form in your
   database. Used internally by the recursing nameserver but you can use
   it too.
-  PowerDNS now knows about SIG and KEY records *names*. It does not
   support them yet but can at least report so now.
-  HINFO records can now be transferred from a master to PowerDNS
   (thanks to Ueli Heuer for noticing it didn't work).
-  Yet more UltraSPARC alignment issues fixed (Chris Andrews).
-  Dropped non-lazy recursion, nobody was using it. Lazy recursion
   became even more lazy after Dan Bernstein pointed out that additional
   processing is not vital, so PowerDNS does its best to do additional
   processing on recursive queries, but does not scream murder if it
   does not succeed. Due to caching, the next identical query will be
   successfully additionally processed.
-  Label compression was improved so we can now fit all . records in 436
   bytes, this used to be 460! (Code & formal proof of correctness by
   Mark Bergsma).
-  SRV support (incoming and outgoing), submitted by Ueli Heuer.
-  Generic backends do not support SOA serial autocalculation, it
   appears. Could lead to random SOA serials in case of a serial of 0 in
   the database. Fixed so that 0 stays zero in that case. Don't set the
   SOA serial to 0 when using Generic MySQL or Generic PostgreSQL!
-  J root-server address was updated to its new location.
-  SIGUSR1 now forces the recursor to print out statistics to the log.
-  Meaning of recursor logging was changed a bit - a cache hit is now a
   question that was answered with 0 outgoing packets needed. Used to be
   a weighted average of internal cache hits.
-  MySQL compilation did not include -lz which causes problems on some
   platforms. Thanks to James H. Cloos Jr for reporting this.
-  After a suggestion by Daniel Meyer and Florus Both, the built in
   webserver now reports the configuration name when multiple PowerDNS
   instances are active.
-  Brad Knowles noticed that zone2sql had problems with the root.zone,
   fixed. This also closes some other zone2sql annoyances with
   converting single zones.

Version 2.9.4
-------------

Yet another grand release. Big news is the addition of a recursing
nameserver which has sprung into existence over the past week. It is in
use on several computers already but it is not ready for prime time.
Complete integration with PowerDNS is expected around 2.9.5, for now the
recursor is a separate program.

In preliminary tests, the recursor appears to be four times faster than
BIND 9 on a naive benchmark starting from a cold cache. BIND 9 managed
to get through to some slower nameservers however, which were given up
on by PowerDNS. We will continue to tune the recursor. See `PowerDNS
Recursor <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/>`__ for further details.

The BIND Backend has also been tested (see the **bind-domain-status**
item below) rather heavily by several parties. After some discussion
online, one of the BIND authors ventured that the newsgroup
comp.protocols.dns.bind may now in fact be an appropriate venue for
discussing PowerDNS. Since this discussion, traffic to the PowerDNS
pages has increased sixfold and shows no signs of slowing down.

From this, it is apparent that far more people are interested in
PowerDNS than yet know about it. So spread the word!

In other news, we now have a security page at
`Security <../security.rst>`__. Furthermore, Maurice Nonnekes
contributed an OpenBSD port! See `his
page <https://web.archive.org/web/20070408142316/http://www.codeninja.nl/projects/openbsd/powerdns/>`__ for more details!

New features and improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  All SQL queries in the generic backends are now available for
   configuration. (Martin Klebermass, Bert Hubert). See `Generic SQL
   backends <../backends/generic-sql.rst>`__.
-  A recursing nameserver! See `PowerDNS
   Recursor <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/>`__.
-  An incoming AXFR now only starts a backend zone replacement
   transaction after the first record arrived successfully, thus making
   sure no work is done when a remote nameserver is unable/unwilling to
   AXFR a zone to us.
-  Zone parser error messages were improved slightly (thanks to Stef van
   Dessel for spotting this shortcoming)
-  XS4ALL's Erik Bos checked how PowerDNS reacted to a BIND installation
   with almost 60.000 domains, some of which with >100.000 records, and
   he discovered the pdns\_control **bind-domain-status** command became
   very slow with larger numbers of domains. Fixed, 60.000 domains are
   now listed in under one second.
-  If a remote nameserver disconnects during an incoming AXFR, the
   update is now rolled back, unless the AXFR was properly terminated.
-  The migration chapter mentioned the use of deprecated backends.

A tremendous number of bugs were discovered and fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone parser would only accept $include and not $INCLUDE
-  Zone parser had problems with $lines with comments on the end
-  Wildcard ANY queries were broken (thanks Colemarcus for spotting
   this)
-  A connection failure with the Generic backends would lead to a
   powerdns reload (cast of many)
-  Generic backends had some semantic problems with slave support.
   Symptoms were oft-repeated notifications and transfers (thanks to
   Mark Bergsma for helping resolve this).
-  Solaris version compiles again. Thanks to Mohamed Lrhazi for
   reporting that it didn't.
-  Some UltraSPARC alignment fixes. Thanks to Mohamed Lrhazi for being
   helpful in spotting these. One problem is still outstanding, Mohamed
   sent a core dump that tells us where the problem is. Expect the fix
   to be in 2.9.5. Volunteers can grep the source for 'UltraSPARC' to
   find where the problem is.
-  Our support of IPv6 on FreeBSD had phase of moon dependent bugs,
   fixed by Peter van Dijk.
-  Some crashes of and by pdns\_control were fixed, thanks to Mark
   Bergsma for helping resolve these.
-  Outgoing AXFR in pdns installations with multiple loaded backends was
   broken (thanks to Stuart Walsh for reporting this).
-  A failed BIND Backend incoming AXFR would block the zone until it
   succeeded again.
-  Generic PostgreSQL backend wouldn't compile with newer libpq++, fixed
   by Julien Lemoine/SpeedBlue.
-  Potential bug (not observed) when listening on multiple interfaces
   fixed.
-  Some typos in manpages fixed (reported by Marco Davids).

Version 2.9.3a
--------------

**Note**: 2.9.3a is identical to 2.9.3 except that zone2sql does work

Broad range of huge improvements. We now have an all-static .rpm and
.deb for Linux users and a link to an OpenBSD port. Major news is that
work on the Bind backend has progressed to the point that we've just
retired our last Bind server and replaced it with PowerDNS in Bind mode!
This server is operating a number of master and slave setups so it
should stress the Bind backend somewhat.

This version is rapidly approaching the point where it is a
better-Bind-than-Bind and nearly a drop-in replacement for authoritative
setups. PowerDNS is now equipped with a powerful master/slave apparatus
that offers a lot of insight and control to the user, even when
operating from Bind zone files and a Bind configuration. Observe.

After the SOA of example.org was raised

::

    pdns[17495]: All slave domains are fresh
    pdns[17495]: 1 domain for which we are master needs notifications
    pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'example.org' to 195.193.163.3
    pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'example.org' to 213.156.2.1
    pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'example.org' initiated by 195.193.163.3
    pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'example.org' to 195.193.163.3 finished
    pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'example.org' initiated by 213.156.2.1
    pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'example.org' to 213.156.2.1 finished
    pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'example.org' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
    pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'example.org' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)
    pdns[17495]: No master domains need notifications

If however our slaves would ignore us, as some are prone to do, we can
send some additional notifications

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo pdns_control notify example.org
    Added to queue
    pdns[17492]: Notification request for domain 'example.org' received
    pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'example.org' to 195.193.163.3
    pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'example.org' to 213.156.2.1
    pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'example.org' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
    pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'example.org' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)

Conversely, if PowerDNS needs to be reminded to retrieve a zone from a
master, a command is provided

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo pdns_control retrieve forfun.net
    Added retrieval request for 'forfun.net' from master 212.187.98.67
    pdns[17495]: AXFR started for 'forfun.net', transaction started
    pdns[17495]: Zone 'forfun.net' (/var/cache/bind/forfun.net) reloaded
    pdns[17495]: AXFR done for 'forfun.net', zone committed

Also, you can force PowerDNS to reload a zone from disk immediately with
**pdns\_control bind-reload-now**. All this happens 'live', per your
instructions. Without instructions, the right things also happen, but
the operator is in charge.

For more about all this coolness, see
`“pdns\_control” <../running.rst#pdnscontrol>`__ and
`“pdns\_control
commands” <../backends/bind.rst#bind-control-commands>`__.

**Warning**: Again some changes in compilation instructions. The hybrid
pgmysql backend has been split up into 'gmysql' and 'gpgsql', sharing a
common base within the PowerDNS server itself. This means that you can
no longer compile **^^with-modules="pgmysql" ^^enable-mysql
^^enable-pgsql** but that you should now use: **^^with-modules="gmysql
gpgsql"**. The old launch-names remain available.

If you launch the Generic PostgreSQL backend as gpgsql2, all parameters
will have gpgsql2 as a prefix, for example **gpgsql2-dbname**. If
launched as gpgsql, the regular names are in effect.

**Warning**: The pdns\_control protocol was changed which means that
older pdns\_controls cannot talk to 2.9.3. The other way around is
broken too. This may lead to problems with automatic upgrade scripts, so
pay attention if your daemon is truly restarted.

Also make sure no old pdns\_control command is around to confuse things.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Bind backend can now deal with missing files and try to find them
   later.
-  Bind backend is now explicitly master capable and triggers the
   sending of notifications.
-  General robustness improvements in Bind backend - many errors are now
   non-fatal.
-  Accessibility, Serviceability. New **pdns\_server** commands like
   **bind-list-rejects** (lists zones that could not be loaded, and the
   reason why), **bind-reload-now** (reload a zone from disk NOW),
   **rediscover** (reread named.conf NOW). More is coming up.
-  Added support for retrieving RP (Responsible Person) records from
   remote masters. Serving them was already possible.
-  Added support for LOC records, which encode the geographical location
   of a host, both serving and retrieving (thanks to Marco Davids using
   them on our last Bind server, forcing us to implement this silly
   record).
-  Configuration file parser now strips leading spaces too, allowing
   "chroot= /tmp" to work, as well as "chroot=/tmp" (Thanks to Hub
   Dohmen for reporting this for months on end).
-  Added **bind-domain-status** command that shows the status of all
   domains (when/if they were parsed, any errors encountered while
   parsing them).
-  Added **bind-reload-now** command that tries to reload a zone from
   disk NOW, and reports back errors to the operator immediately.
-  Added **retrieve** command that queues a request to retrieve a zone
   from its master.
-  Zones retrieved from masters are now stored way smaller on disk
   because the domain is stripped from records, which is derived from
   the configuration file. Retrieved zones are now prefixed with some
   information on where they came from.

Changes
^^^^^^^

-  gpgsql and gmysql backends split out of the hybrid pgmysqlbackend.
   This again changed compilation instructions!
-  **pdns\_control** now uses the rarely seen SOCK\_STREAM Unix Domain
   socket variety so it can transport large amounts of text, which is
   needed for the **bind-domain-status** command, for which see
   `Pdns\_control
   commands <../backends/bind.rst#bind-control-commands>`__.
   This breaks compatibility with older pdns\_control and pdns\_server
   binaries!
-  Bind backend now ignores 'hint' and 'forward' and other unsupported
   zone types.
-  AXFRs are now logged more heavily by default. An AXFR is a heavy
   operation anyhow, some more logging does not further increase the
   load materially. Does help in clearing up what slaves are doing.
-  A lot of master/slave chatter has been silenced, making output more
   relevant. No more repetitive 'No master domains need notifications'
   etc, only changes are reported now.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

-  Windows version did not compile without minor changes.
-  Confusing error reporting on Windows 98 (which does not support
   PowerDNS) fixed
-  Potential crashes with shortened packets addressed. An upgrade is
   advised!
-  **notify** (which was already there, just badly documented) no longer
   prints out debugging garbage.
-  pgmysql backend had problems launching when not compiled in but
   available as a module. Workaround for 2.9.2 is
   'load-modules=pgmysql', but even then gpgsql would not work! gmysql
   would then, however. These modules are now split out, removing such
   issues.

 Version 2.9.2
--------------

Bugfixes galore. Solaris porting created some issues on all platforms.
Great news is that PowerDNS is now in Debian 'sid' (unstable). The 2.9.1
packages in there currently aren't very good but the 2.9.2 ones will be.
Many thanks to Wichert Akkerman, our 'downstream' for making this
possible.

**Warning**: The Generic MySQL backend, part of the Generic MySQL &
PostgreSQL backend, is now the DEFAULT! The previous default, the
'mysql' backend (note the lack of 'g') is now DEPRECATED. This was the
source of much confusion. The 'mysql' backend does not support MASTER or
SLAVE operation. The Generic backends do.

To get back the mysql backend, add ^^with-modules="mysql" or
^^with-dynmodules="mysql" if you prefer to load your modules at runtime.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Silly debugging output removed from the webserver (found by Paul
   Wouters)
-  SEVERE: due to Solaris portability fixes, qtypes<127 were broken.
   These include NAPTR, ANY and AXFR. The upshot is that powerdns wasn't
   performing outgoing AXFRs nor ANY queries. These were the 'question
   for type -1' warnings in the log
-  incoming AXFR could theoretically miss some trailing records (not
   observed, but could happen)
-  incoming AXFR did not support TXT records (spotted by Paul Wouters)
-  with some remotes, an incoming AXFR would not terminate until a
   timeout occurred (observed by Paul Wouters)
-  Documentation bug, pgmysql != mypgsql

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Documented the 'random backend', see `Random
   Backend <../backends/random.rst>`__.
-  Wichert Akkerman contributed three manpages.
-  Building PowerDNS on Unix is now documented somewhat more, see
   `Compiling PowerDNS on
   Unix <../appendices/compiling.rst#on-unix>`__.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  pdns init.d script is now +x by default
-  OpenBSD is on its way of becoming a supported platform! As of 2.9.2,
   PowerDNS compiles on OpenBSD but swiftly crashes. Help is welcome.
-  ODBC backend (for Windows only) was missing from the distribution,
   now added.
-  xdb backend added.
   Designed for use by root-server operators.
-  Dynamic modules are back which is good news for distributors who want
   to make a pdns packages that does not depend one every database under
   the sun.

Version 2.9.1
-------------

Thanks to the great enthusiasm from around the world, powerdns is now
available for Solaris and FreeBSD users again! Furthermore, the Windows
build is back. We are very grateful for the help of

-  Michel Stol
-  Wichert Akkerman
-  Edvard Tuinder
-  Koos van den Hout
-  Niels Bakker
-  Erik Bos
-  Alex Bleker
-  Steven Stillaway
-  Roel van der Made
-  Steven Van Steen

We are happy to have been able to work with the open source community to
improve PowerDNS!

Changes
^^^^^^^

-  The monitor command **set** no longer allows the changing of
   nonexistent variables.
-  IBM Universal Database DB2 backend now included in source
   distribution (untested!)
-  Oracle backend now included in source distribution (slightly tested!)
-  configure script now searches for postgresql and mysql includes
-  Bind parser now no longer dies on records with a ' in them (Erik Bos)
-  The pipebackend was accidentally left out of 2.9
-  FreeBSD fixes (with help from Erik Bos, Alex Bleeker, Niels Bakker)
-  Heap of Solaris work (with help from Edvard Tuinder, Stefan Van
   Steen, Koos van den Hout, Roel van der Made and especially Mark
   Bakker). Now compiles in 2.7 and 2.8, haven't tried 2.9. May be a bit
   dysfunctional on 2.7 though - it won't do IPv6 and it won't serve
   AAAA. Patches welcome!
-  Windows 32 build is back! Michel Stol updated his earlier work to the
   current version.
-  S/Linux (Linux on Sparc) build works now (with help from Steven
   Stillaway).
-  Silly debugging message ('sd.ttl from cache') removed
-  .deb files are back, hopefully in 'sid' soon! (Wichert Akkerman)
-  Removal of bzero and other less portable constructs. Discovered that
   recent Linux glibc's need -D\_GNU\_SOURCE (Wichert Akkerman).

Version 2.9
-----------

Open source release. Do not deploy unless you know what you are doing.
Stability is expected to return with 2.9.1, as are the binary builds.

-  License changed to the GNU General Public License version 2.
-  Cleanups by Erik Bos @ xs4all.
-  Build improvements by Wichert Akkerman
-  Lots of work on the build system, entirely revamped. By PowerDNS.

Version 2.8
-----------

From this release onwards, we'll concentrate on stabilising for the 3.0
release. So if you have any must-have features, let us know soonest. The
2.8 release fixes a bunch of small stability issues and add two new
features. In the spirit of the move to stability, this release has
already been running 24 hours on our servers before release.

-  pipe backend gains the ability to restricts its invocation to a
   limited number of requests. This allows a very busy nameserver to
   still serve packets from a slow perl backend.
-  pipe backend now honors query-logging, which also documents which
   queries were blocked by the regex.
-  pipe backend now has its own backend chapter.
-  An incoming AXFR timeout at the wrong moment had the ability to crash
   the binary, forcing a reload. Thanks to our bug spotting champions
   Mike Benoit and Simon Kirby of NetNation for reporting this.

Version 2.7 and 2.7.1
---------------------

This version fixes some very long-standing issues and adds a few new
features. If you are still running 2.6, upgrade yesterday. If you were
running 2.6.1, an upgrade is still strongly advised.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  The controlsocket is now readable and writable by the 'setgid' user.
   This allows for non-root access to PowerDNS which is nice for mrtg or
   cricket graphs.
-  MySQL backend (the non-generic one) gains the ability to read from a
   different table using the **mysql-table** setting.
-  pipe backend now has a configurable timeout using the
   **pipe-timeout** setting. Thanks to Steve Bromwich for pointing out
   the need for this.
-  Experimental backtraces. If PowerDNS crashes, it will log a lot of
   numbers and sometimes more to the syslog. If you see these, please
   report them to us. Only available under Linux.

Bugs
^^^^

-  2.7 briefly broke the mysql backend, so don't use it if you use that.
   2.7.1 fixes this.
-  SOA records could sometimes have the wrong TTL. Thanks to Jonas
   Daugaard for reporting this.
-  An ANY query might lead to duplicate SOA records being returned under
   exceptional circumstances. Thanks to Jonas Daugaard for reporting
   this.
-  Underlying the above bug, packet compression could sometimes suddenly
   be turned off, leading to overly large responses and non-removal of
   duplicate records.
-  The **allow-axfr-ips** setting did not accept IP ranges
   (192.0.2.0/24) which the documentation claimed it did (thanks to
   Florus Both of Ascio technologies for being sufficiently persistent
   in reporting this).
-  Killed backends were not being respawned, leading to suboptimal
   behaviour on intermittent database errors. Thanks to Steve Bromwich
   for reporting this.
-  Corrupt packets during an incoming AXFR when acting as a slave would
   cause a PowerDNS reload instead of just failing that AXFR. Thanks to
   Mike Benoit and Simon Kirby of NetNation for reporting this.
-  Label compression in incoming AXFR had problems with large offsets,
   causing the above mentioned errors. Thanks to Mike Benoit and Simon
   Kirby of NetNation for reporting this.

Version 2.6.1
-------------

Quick fix release for a big cache problem.

 Version 2.6
------------

Performance release. A lot of work has been done to raise PowerDNS
performance to staggering levels in order to take part in benchmarking
efforts. Together with our as yet unnamed partner, PowerDNS has been
benchmarked at 60.000 mostly cached queries/second on off the shelf PC
hardware. Uncached performance was 17.000 uncached DNS queries/second on
the .ORG domain.

Performance has been increased by both making PowerDNS itself quicker
but also by lowering the number of backend queries typically needed.
Operators will typically see PowerDNS taking less CPU and the backend
seeing less load.

Furthermore, some real bugs were fixed. A couple of undocumented
performance switches may appear in ^^help output but you are advised to
stay away from these.

Developers: this version needs the pdns-2.5.1 development kit, available
on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also `Backend
writers' guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  A big error in latency calculations - cached packets were weighed 50
   times less, leading to inflated latency reporting. Latency
   calculations are now correct and way lower - often in the
   microseconds range.
-  It is now possible to run with 0 second cache TTLs. This used to
   cause very frequent cache cleanups, leading to performance
   degradation.
-  Many tiny performance improvements, removing duplicate cache key
   calculations, etc. The cache itself has also been reworked to be more
   efficient.
-  First 'CNAME' backend query replaced by an 'ANY' query, which most of
   the time returns the actual record, preventing the need for a
   separate CNAME lookup, halving query load.
-  Much of the same for same-level-NS records on queries needing
   delegation.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Incidentally, the cache count would show 'unknown' packets, which was
   harmless but confusing. Thanks to Mike and Simon of NetNation for
   reporting this.
-  SOA hostmaster with a . in the local-part would be cached wrongly,
   leading to a stray backslash in case of multiple successively SOA
   queries. Thanks to Ascio Technologies for spotting this bug.
-  zone2sql did not parse Verisign zone files correctly as these
   contained a $TTL statement in mid-record.
-  Sometimes packets would not be accounted, leading to 'udp-queries'
   and 'udp-answers' divergence.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  'cricket' command added to init.d scripts that provides unadorned
   output for parsing by 'Cricket'.

Version 2.5.1
-------------

`Brown paper
bag <https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3008/pg3008-images.html#brown-paper-bagbug>`__
release fixing a huge memory leak in the new Query Cache.

Developers: this version needs the new pdns-2.5.1 development kit,
available on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also
`Backend writers' guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.

And some small changes

-  Added support for RFC 2308 compliant negative-answer caching. This
   allows remotes to cache the fact that a domain does not exist and
   will not exist for a while. Thanks to Chris Thompson for `pointing
   out how tiny our minds
   are <https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/namedroppers/oqzDiPVjxPuAKqK9IZh9eiEif6w/>`__.
   This feature may cause a noticeable reduction in query load.
-  Small speedup to non-packet-cached queries, incidentally fixing the
   huge memory leak.
-  **pdns\_control ccounts** command outputs statistics on what is in
   the cache, which is useful to help optimize your caching strategy.

Version 2.5
-----------

An important release which has seen quite a lot of trial and error
testing. As a result, PowerDNS can now run with a huge cache and
concurrent invalidations. This is useful when running of a slower
database or under high traffic load with a fast database.

Furthermore, the gpgsql2 backend has been validated for use and will
soon supplant the gpgsql backend entirely. This also bodes well for the
gmysql backend which is the same code.

Also, a large amount of issues biting large scale slave operators were
addressed. Most of these issues would only show up after prolonged
uptime.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Query cache. The old Packet Cache only cached entire questions and
   their answers. This is very CPU efficient but does not lead to
   maximum hitrate. Two packets both needing to resolve smtp.you.com
   internally would not benefit from any caching. Furthermore, many
   different DNS queries lead to the same backend queries, like 'SOA for
   .COM?'.

   PowerDNS now also caches backend queries, but only those having no
   answer (the majority) and those having one answer (almost the rest).

   In tests, these additional caches appear to halve the database
   backend load numerically and perhaps even more in terms of CPU load.
   Often, queries with no answer are more expensive than those having
   one.

   The default **ttl**\ s for the query-cache and negquery-cache are set
   to safe values (20 and 60 seconds respectively), you should be seeing
   an improvement in behaviour without sacrificing a lot in terms of
   quick updates.

   The webserver also displays the efficiency of the new Query Cache.

   The old Packet Cache is still there (and useful) but see
   `Authoritative Server Performance <../performance.rst>`__
   for more details.

-  There is now the ability to shut off some logging at a very early
   stage. High performance sites doing thousands of queries/second may
   in fact spend most of their CPU time on attempting to write out
   logging, even though it is ignored by syslog. The new flag
   **log-dns-details**, on by default, allows the operator to kill most
   informative-only logging before it takes any cpu.
-  Flags which can be switched 'on' and 'off' can now also be set to
   'off' instead of only to 'no' to turn them off.

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Packet Cache is now case-insensitive, leading to a higher hitrate
   because identical queries only differing in case now both match. Care
   is taken to restore the proper case in the answer sent out.
-  Packet Cache stores packets more efficiently now, savings are
   estimated at 50%.
-  The Packet Cache is now asynchronous which means that PowerDNS
   continues to answer questions while the cache is busy being purged or
   queried. Incidentally this will mean a cache miss where previously
   the question would wait until the cache became available again.

   The upshot of this is that operators can call **pdns\_control purge**
   as often as desired without fearing performance loss. Especially the
   full, non-specific, purge was sped up tremendously.

   This optimization is of little merit for small sites but is very
   important when running with a large packetcache, such as when using
   recursion under high load.

-  AXFR log messages now all contain the word 'AXFR' to ease grepping.
-  Linux static version now compiled with gcc 3.2 which is known to
   output better and faster code than the previously used 3.0.4.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Packetcache would sometimes send packets back with slightly modified
   flags if these differed from the flags of the cached copy.
-  Resolver code did bad things with file descriptors leading to fd
   exhaustion after prolonged uptimes and many slave SOA currency
   checks.
-  Resolver code failed to properly log some errors, leading to operator
   uncertainty regarding to AXFR problems with remote masters.
-  After prolonged uptime, slave code would try to use privileged ports
   for originating queries, leading to bad replication efficiency.
-  Masters sending back answers in differing case from questions would
   lead to bogus 'Master tried to sneak in out-of-zone data' errors and
   failing AXFRs.

Version 2.4
-----------

Developers: this version is compatible with the pdns-2.1 development
kit, available on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also
`*Backend writers' guide* <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.

This version fixes some stability issues with malformed or malcrafted
packets. An upgrade is advised. Furthermore, there are interesting new
features.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Recursive queries are now also cached, but in a separate namespace so
   non-recursive queries don't get recursed answers and vice versa. This
   should mean way lower database load for sites running with the
   current default lazy-recursion. Up to now, each and every recursive
   query would lead to a large amount of SQL queries.

   To prevent the packetcache from becoming huge, a separate
   **recursive-cache-ttl** can be specified.

-  The ability to change parameters at runtime was added. Currently,
   only the new **query-logging** flag can be changed.
-  Added **query-logging** flag which hints a backend that it should
   output a textual representation of queries it receives. Currently
   only gmysql and gpgsql2 honor this flag.
-  Gmysql backend can now also talk to PostgreSQL, leading to less code.
   Currently, the old postgresql driver ('gpgsql') is still the default,
   the new driver is available as 'gpgsql2' and has the benefit that it
   does query logging. In the future, gpgsql2 will become the default
   gpgsql driver.
-  DNS recursing proxy is now more verbose in logging odd events which
   may be caused by buggy recursing backends.
-  Webserver now displays peak queries/second 1 minute average.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Failure to connect to database in master/slave communicator thread
   could lead to an unclean reload, fixed.

Documentation: added details for **strict-rfc-axfrs**. This feature can
be used if very old clients need to be able to do zone transfers with
PowerDNS. Very slow.

Version 2.3
-----------

Developers: this version is compatible with the pdns-2.1 development
kit, available on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also
`Backend writers' guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__

This release adds the Generic MySQL backend which allows full
master/slave semantics with MySQL and InnoDB tables (or other tables
that support transactions). See `Generic MySQL
backend <../backends/generic-mysql.rst>`__.

Other new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Improved error messages in master/slave communicator will help down
   track problems.
-  **slave-cycle-interval** setting added. Very large sites with
   thousands of slave domains may need to raise this value above the
   default of 60. Every cycle, domains in indeterminate state are
   checked for their condition. Depending on the health of the masters,
   this may entail many SOA queries or attempted AXFRs.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  'pdns\_control purge **``domain``**' and 'pdns\_control purge
   **``domain$``**' were broken in version 2.2 and did not in fact purge
   the cache. There is a slight risk that domain-specific purge commands
   could force a reload in previous version. Thanks to Mike Benoit of
   NetNation for discovering this.
-  Master/slave communicator thread got confused in case of delayed
   answers from slow masters. While not causing harm, this caused
   inefficient behaviour when testing large amounts of slave domains
   because additional 'cycles' had to pass before all domains would have
   their status ascertained.
-  Backends implementing special SOA semantics (currently only the
   undocumented 'pdns express backend', or homegrown backends) would
   under some circumstances not answer the SOA record in case of an ANY
   query. This should put an end to the last DENIC problems. Thanks to
   DENIC for helping us find the problem.

Version 2.2
-----------

Developers: this version is compatible with the pdns-2.1 development
kit, available on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also
`Backend writers' guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__

Again a big release. PowerDNS is seeing some larger deployments in more
demanding environments and these are helping shake out remaining issues,
especially with recursing backends.

The big news is that wildcard CNAMEs are now supported, an oft requested
feature and nearly the only part in which PowerDNS differed from BIND in
authoritative capabilities.

If you were seeing signal 6 errors in PowerDNS causing reloads and
intermittent service disruptions, please upgrade to this version.

For operators of PowerDNS Express trying to host .DE domains, the very
special **soa-serial-offset** feature has been added to placate the new
DENIC requirement that the SOA serial be at least six digits. PowerDNS
Express uses the SOA serial as an actual serial and not to insert dates
and hence often has single digit soa serial numbers, causing big
problems with .DE redelegations.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Malformed or shortened TCP recursion queries would cause a signal 6
   and a reload. Same for EOF from the TCP recursing backend. Thanks to
   Simon Kirby and Mike Benoit of NetNation for helping debug this.
-  Timeouts on the TCP recursing backend were far too long, leading to
   possible exhaustion of TCP resolving threads.
-  **pdns\_control purge domain** accidentally cleaned all packets with
   that name as a prefix. Thanks to Simon Kirby for spotting this.
-  Improved exception error logging - in some circumstances PowerDNS
   would not properly log the cause of an exception, which hampered
   problem resolution.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Wildcard CNAMEs now work as expected!
-  **pdns\_control purge** can now also purge based on suffix, allowing
   operators to purge an entire domain from the packet cache instead of
   only specific records. See also
   `pdns\_control <../running.rst#pdnscontrol>`__ Thanks to
   Mike Benoit for this suggestion.
-  **soa-serial-offset** for installations with small SOA serial numbers
   wishing to register .DE domains with DENIC which demands six-figure
   SOA serial numbers. See also `Chapter 21, *Index of all Authoritative
   Server settings* <../settings.rst>`__.

Version 2.1
-----------

This is a somewhat bigger release due to pressing demands from
customers. An upgrade is advised for installations using Recursion. If
you are using recursion, it is vital that you are aware of changes in
semantics. Basically, local data will now override data in your
recursing backend under most circumstances. Old behaviour can be
restored by turning **lazy-recursion** off.

Developers: this version has a new pdns-2.1 development kit, available
on https://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev. See also `Backend
writers' guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.

**Warning**: Most users will run a static version of PowerDNS which has
no dependencies on external libraries. However, some may need to run the
dynamic version. This warning applies to these users.

To run the dynamic version of PowerDNS, which is needed for backend
drivers which are only available in source form, gcc 3.0 is required.
Red Hat 7.2 comes with gcc 3.0 as an optional component, Red Hat 7.3 does
not. However, the Red Hat 7.2 Update gcc rpms install just fine on Red Hat
7.3. For Debian, we suggest running 'woody' and installing the g++-3.0
package. We expect to release a FreeBSD dynamic version shortly.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  RPM releases sometimes overwrote previous configuration files. Thanks
   to Jorn Ekkelenkamp of Hubris/ISP Services for reporting this.
-  TCP recursion sent out overly large responses due to a byte order
   mistake, confusing some clients. Thanks to the capable engineers of
   NetNation for bringing this to our attention.
-  TCP recursion in combination with a recursing backend on a
   non-standard port did not work, leading to a non-functioning TCP
   listener. Thanks to the capable engineers of NetNation for bringing
   this to our attention.

Unexpected behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Wildcard URL records where not implemented because they are a
   performance penalty. To turn these on, enable **wildcard-url** in the
   configuration.
-  Unlike other nameservers, local data did not override the internet
   for recursing queries. This has mostly been brought into conformance
   with user expectations. If a recursive question can be answered
   entirely from local data, it is. To restore old behaviour, disable
   **lazy-recursion**. Also see
   `Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  Oracle support has been tuned, leading to the first public release of
   the Oracle backend. Zone2sql now outputs better SQL and the backend
   is now fully documented. Furthermore, the queries are compatible with
   the PowerDNS XML-RPC product, allowing PowerDNS express to run off
   Oracle.
-  Zone2sql now accepts ^^transactions to wrap zones in a transaction
   for PostgreSQL and Oracle output. This is a major speedup and also
   makes for better isolation of inserts. See
   `Zone2sql <../migration.rst#zone2sql>`__.
-  **pdns\_control** now has the ability to purge the PowerDNS cache or
   parts of it. This enables operators to raise the TTL of the Packet
   Cache to huge values and only to invalidate the cache when changes
   are made. See also `Authoritative Server
   Performance <../performance.rst>`__ and
   `pdns\_control <../running.rst#pdnscontrol>`__.

Version 2.0.1
-------------

Maintenance release, fixing three small issues.

Developers: this version is compatible with 1.99.11 backends.

-  PowerDNS ignored the **logging-facility** setting unless it was
   specified on the command line. Thanks to Karl Obermayer from
   WebMachine Technologies for noticing this.
-  Zone2sql neglected to preserve 'slaveness' of domains when converting
   to the slave capable PostgreSQL backend. Thanks to Mike Benoit of
   NetNation for reporting this. Zone2sql now has a **^^slave** option.
-  SOA Hostmaster addresses with dots in them before the @-sign were
   mis-encoded on the wire.

Version 2.0
-----------

Two bugfixes, one stability/security related. No new features.

Developers: this version is compatible with 1.99.11 backends.

Bugfixes - zone2sql refused to work under some circumstances, taking
100% cpu and not functioning. Thanks to Andrew Clark and Mike Benoit for
reporting this. - Fixed a stability issue where malformed packets could
force PowerDNS to reload. Present in all earlier 2.0 versions.

Version 2.0 Release Candidate 2
-------------------------------

Mostly bugfixes, no really new features.

Developers: this version is compatible with 1.99.11 backends.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  chroot() works again - 2.0rc1 silently refused to chroot. Thanks to
   Hub Dohmen for noticing this.
-  setuid() and setgid() security features were silently not being
   performed in 2.0rc1. Thanks to Hub Dohmen for noticing this.
-  MX preferences over 255 now work as intended. Thanks to Jeff Crowe
   for noticing this.
-  IPv6 clients can now also benefit from the recursing backend feature.
   Thanks to Andy Furnell for proving beyond any doubt that this did not
   work.
-  Extremely bogus code removed from DNS notification reception code -
   please test! Thanks to Jakub Jermar for working with us in figuring
   out just how broken this was.
-  AXFR code improved to handle more of the myriad different zone
   transfer dialects available. Specifically, interoperability with Bind
   4 was improved, as well as Bind 8 in 'strict rfc conformance' mode.
   Thanks again for Jakub Jermar for running many tests for us. If your
   transfers failed with 'Unknown type 14!!' or words to that effect,
   this was it.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  Win32 version now has a zone2sql tool.
-  Win32 version now has support for specifying how urgent messages
   should be before they go to the NT event log.

Remaining issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  One persistent report of the default 'chroot=./' configuration not
   working.
-  One report of disable-axfr and allow-axfr-ips not working as
   intended.
-  Support for relative paths in zones and in Bind configuration is not
   bug-for-bug compatible with bind yet.

Version 2.0 Release Candidate 1
-------------------------------

The Mac OS X release! A very experimental OS X 10.2 build has been added.
Furthermore, the Windows version is now in line with Unix with respect
to capabilities. The ODBC backend now has the code to function as both a
master and a slave.

Developers: this version is compatible with 1.99.11 backends.

-  Implemented native packet response parsing code, allowing Windows to
   perform AXFR and NS and SOA queries.
-  This is the first version for which we have added support for Darwin
   6.0, which is part of the forthcoming Mac OS X 10.2. Please note that
   although this version is marked RC1, that we have not done extensive
   testing yet. Consider this a technology preview.

   -  The Darwin version has been developed on Mac OS X 10.2 (6C35).
      Other versions may or may not work.
   -  Currently only the random, bind, mysql and pdns backends are
      included.
   -  The menu based installer script does not work, you will have to
      edit pathconfig by hand as outlined in chapter 2.
   -  On Mac OS X Client, PowerDNS will fail to start because a system
      service is already bound to port 53.

   This version is distributed as a compressed tar file. You should
   follow the generic UNIX installation instructions.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone2sql PostgreSQL mode neglected to lowercase $ORIGIN. Thanks to
   Maikel Verheijen of Ladot for spotting this.
-  Zone2sql PostgreSQL mode neglected to remove a trailing dot from
   $ORIGIN if present. Thanks to Thanks to Maikel Verheijen of Ladot for
   spotting this.
-  Zone file parser was not compatible with bind when $INCLUDING
   non-absolute file names. Thanks to Jeff Miller for working out how
   this should work.
-  Bind configuration parser was not compatible with bind when including
   non-absolute file names. Thanks to Jeff Miller for working out how
   this should work.
-  Documentation incorrectly listed the Bind backend as 'slave capable'.
   This is not yet true, now labeled 'experimental'.

Windows changes. We are indebted to Dimitry Andric who educated us in
the ways of distributing Windows software.

-  ``pdns.conf`` is now read if available.
-  Console version responds to ^c now.
-  Default pdns.conf added to distribution
-  Uninstaller missed several files, leaving remnants behind
-  DLLs are now installed locally, with the pdns executable.
-  pdns\_control is now also available on Windows
-  ODBC backend can now act as master and slave. Experimental.
-  The example zone missed indexes and had other faults.
-  A runtime DLL that is present on most windows systems (but not all!)
   was missing.

Version 1.99.12 Prerelease
--------------------------

The Windows release! See `Installing on Microsoft
Windows <../installation.rst>`__. Beware, windows support is
still very fresh and untested. Feedback is very welcome.

Developers: this version is compatible with 1.99.11 backends.

-  Windows 2000 code base merge completed. This resulted in quite some
   changes on the Unix end of things, so this may impact reliability.
-  ODBC backend added for Windows. See `ODBC
   backend <../backends/generic-odbc.rst>`__.
-  IBM DB2 Universal Database backend available for Linux.
-  Zone2sql now understands $INCLUDE. Thanks to Amaze Internet for
   nagging about this
-  The SOA Minimum TTL now has a configurable default
   (**soa-minimum-ttl**)value to placate the DENIC requirements.
-  Added a limit on the simultaneous numbers of TCP connections to
   accept (**max-tcp-connections**). Defaults to 10.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  When operating in virtual hosting mode (See `Virtual
   hosting <../running.rst#virtual-hosting>`__), the
   additional init.d scripts would not function correctly and interface
   with other pdns instances.
-  PowerDNS neglected to conserve case on answers. So a query for
   WwW.PoWeRdNs.CoM would get an answer listing the address of
   www.powerdns.com. While this did not confuse resolvers, it is better
   to conserve case. This has semantic consequences for all backends,
   which the documentation now spells out.
-  PostgreSQL backend was case-sensitive and returned only answers in
   case an exact match was found. The Generic PostgreSQL backend is now
   officially all lower case and zone2sql in PostgreSQL mode enforces
   this. Documentation has been updated to reflect the case change.
   Thanks to Maikel Verheijen of Ladot for spotting this!
-  Documentation bug - postgresql create/index statements created a
   duplicate index. If you've previously copy pasted the commands and
   not noticed the error, execute **CREATE INDEX rec\_name\_index ON
   records(name)** to remedy. Thanks to Jeff Miller for reporting this.
   This also lead to depressingly slow 'ANY' lookups for those of you
   doing benchmarks.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  pdns\_control (see
   `pdns\_control <../running.rst#pdnscontrol>`__) now opens
   the local end of its socket in ``/tmp`` instead of next to the remote
   socket (by default ``/var/run``). This eases the way for allowing
   non-root access to pdns\_control. When running chrooted (see
   `Chapter 7, *Security settings &
   considerations* <../security.rst>`__), the local socket again
   moves back to ``/var/run``.
-  pdns\_control now has a 'version' command. See `Section 1.1,
   “pdns\_control” <../running.rst#pdnscontrol>`__.

Version 1.99.11 Prerelease
--------------------------

This release is important because it is the first release which is
accompanied by an Open Source Backend Development Kit, allowing external
developers to write backends for PowerDNS. Furthermore, a few bugs have
been fixed

-  Lines with only whitespace in zone files confused PowerDNS (thanks
   Henk Wevers)
-  PowerDNS did not properly parse TTLs with symbolic suffixes in zone
   files, ie 2H instead of 7200 (thanks Henk Wevers)

Version 1.99.10 Prerelease
--------------------------

**IMPORTANT**: there has been a tiny license change involving free
public webbased dns hosting, check out the changes before deploying!

PowerDNS is now feature complete, or very nearly so. Besides adding
features, a lot of 'fleshing out' work is done now. There is an
important performance bug fix which may have lead to disappointing
benchmarks - so if you saw any of that, please try either this version
or 1.99.8 which also does not have the bug.

This version has been very stable for us on multiple hosts, as was
1.99.9.

PostgreSQL users should be aware that while 1.99.10 works with the
schema as presented in earlier versions, advanced features such as
master or slave support will not work unless you create the new
'domains' table as well.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Wildcard AAAA queries sometimes received an NXDOMAIN error where they
   should have gotten an empty NO ERROR. Thanks to Jeroen Massar for
   spotting this on the .TK TLD!
-  Do not disable the packetcache for 'recursion desired' packets unless
   a recursor was configured. Thanks to Greg Schueler for noticing this.
-  A failing backend would not be reinstated. Thanks to 'Webspider' for
   discovering this problem with PostgreSQL connections that die after
   prolonged inactivity.
-  Fixed loads of IPv6 transport problems. Thanks to Marco Davids and
   others for testing. Considered ready for production now.
-  **Zone2sql** printed a debugging statement on range $GENERATE
   commands. Thanks to Rene van Valkenburg for spotting this.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS can now act as a master, sending out notifications in case
   of changes and allowing slaves to AXFR. Big rewording of replication
   support, domains are now either 'native', 'master' or 'slave'. See
   `Master/Slave operation &
   replication <../modes-of-operation.rst>`__ for lots of
   details.
-  **Zone2sql** in PostgreSQL mode now populates the 'domains' table for
   easy master, slave or native replication support.
-  Ability to run on IPv6 transport only
-  Logging can now happen under a 'facility' so all PowerDNS messages
   appear in their own file. See `Operational logging using
   syslog <../running.rst>`__.
-  Different OS releases of PowerDNS now get different install path
   defaults. Thanks to Mark Lastdrager for nagging about this and to
   Nero Imhard and Frederique Rijsdijk for suggesting saner defaults.
-  Infrastructure for 'also-notify' statements added.

Version 1.99.9 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

This is again a feature and an infrastructure release. We are nearly
feature complete and will soon start work on the backends to make sure
that they are all master, slave and 'superslave' capable.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  PowerDNS sometimes sent out duplicate replies for packets passed to
   the recursing backend. Mostly a problem on SMP systems. Thanks to
   Mike Benoit for noticing this.
-  Out-of-bailiwick CNAMEs (ie, a CNAME to a domain not in PowerDNS)
   caused a 'ServFail' packet in 1.99.8, indicating failure, leading to
   hosts not resolving. Thanks to Martin Gillstrom for noticing this.
-  Zone2sql balked at zones edited under operating systems terminating
   files with ^Z (Windows). Thanks Brian Willcott for reporting this.
-  PostgreSQL backend logged the password used to connect. Now only does
   so in case of failure to connect. Thanks to 'Webspider' for noticing
   this.
-  Debian unstable distribution wrongly depended on home compiled
   PostgreSQL libraries. Thanks to Konrad Wojas for noticing this.

Features
^^^^^^^^

-  When operating as a slave, AAAA records are now supported in the
   zone. They were already supported in master zones.
-  IPv6 transport support - PowerDNS can now listen on an IPv6 socket
   using the **local-ipv6** setting.
-  Very silly randombackend added which appears in the documentation as
   a sample backend. See `Backend writers'
   guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.
-  When transferring a slave zone from a master, out of zone data is now
   rejected. Malicious operators might try to insert bad records
   otherwise.
-  'Supermaster' support for automatic provisioning from masters. See
   `Supermaster automatic provisioning of
   slaves <../modes-of-operation.rst#supermaster>`__.
-  Recursing backend can now live on a non-standard (!=53) port. See
   `Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__.
-  Slave zone retrieval is now queued instead of immediate, which scales
   better and is more resilient to temporary failures.
-  **max-queue-length** parameter. If this many packets are queued for
   database attention, consider the situation hopeless and respawn.

Internal
^^^^^^^^

-  SOA records are now 'special' and each backend can optionally
   generate them in special ways. PostgreSQL backend does so when
   operating as a slave.
-  Writing backends is now a lot easier. See `Backend writers'
   guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide.rst>`__.
-  Added Bindbackend to internal regression tests, confirming that it is
   compliant.

Version 1.99.8 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

A lot of infrastructure work gearing up to 2.0. Some stability bugs
fixed and a lot of new features.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Bindbackend was overly complex and crashed on some systems on
   startup. Simplified launch code.
-  SOA fields were not always properly filled in, causing default values
   to go out on the wire
-  Obscure bug triggered by malicious packets (we know who you are) in
   SOA finding code fixed.
-  Magic serial number calculation contained a double free leading to
   instability.
-  Standards violation, questions for domains for which PowerDNS was
   unauthoritative now get a SERVFAIL answer. Thanks to the IETF
   Namedroppers list for helping out with this.
-  Slowly launching backends were being relaunched at a great rate when
   queries were coming in while launching backends.
-  MySQL-on-unix-domain-socket on SMP systems was overwhelmed by the
   quick connection rate on launch, inserted a small 50ms delay.
-  Some SMP problems appear to be compiler related. Shifted to GCC 3.0.4
   for Linux.
-  Ran ispell on documentation.

Feature enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Recursing backend. See `Recursion <../guides/recursion.rst>`__.
   Allows recursive and authoritative DNS on the same IP address.
-  `NAPTR support <../appendices/types.rst#naptr>`__, which is especially useful for
   the ENUM/E.164 community.
-  Zone transfers can now be allowed per `netmask instead of only per IP
   address <../settings.rst#allow-axfr-ips>`__.
-  Preliminary support for slave operation included. Only for the
   adventurous right now! See `Slave
   operation <../modes-of-operation.rst>`__
-  All record types now documented, see `Supported record types and
   their storage <../appendices/types.rst>`__.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Wildcard CNAMEs do not work as they do with bind.
-  Recursion sometimes sends out duplicate packets (fixed in 1.99.9
   snapshots)

can now be parsed. Furthermore, error reporting was improved. Stability
is looking good.

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Bind parser got confused by file names with underscores and colons.
-  Bind parser got confused by spaces in quoted names
-  FreeBSD version now stops and starts when instructed to do so.
-  Wildcards were off by default, which violates standards. Now on by
   default.
-  ^^oracle was broken in zone2sql

Feature enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Line number counting goes on as it should when including files in
   named.conf
-  Added ^^no-config to enable users to start the pdns daemon without
   parsing the configuration file.
-  zone2sql now has ^^bare for unformatted output which can be used to
   generate insert statements for different database layouts
-  zone2sql now has ^^gpgsql, which is an alias for ^^mysql, to output
   in a format useful for the default Generic PostgreSQL backend
-  zone2sql is now documented.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

Wildcard CNAMEs do not work as they do with bind.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release - gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.

Version 1.99.6 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

This version is now running on dns-eu1.powerdns.net and working very
well for us. But please remain cautious before deploying!

Bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Webserver neglected to show log messages
-  TCP question/answer miscounted multiple questions over one socket.
   Fixed misnaming of counter
-  Packetcache now detects clock skew and times out entries
-  named.conf parser now reports errors with line number and offending
   token
-  File names in named.conf can now contain:

Feature enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The webserver now by default does not print out configuration
   statements, which might contain database backends. Use
   **webserver-print-arguments** to restore the old behaviour.
-  Generic PostgreSQL backend is now included. Still rather beta.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

-  FreeBSD version does not stop when requested to do so.
-  Wildcard CNAMEs do not work as they do with bind.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release - gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.

Version 1.99.5 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

The main focus of this release is stability and TCP improvements. This
is the first release PowerDNS-the-company actually considers for running
on its production servers!

Major bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone2sql received a floating point division by zero error on
   named.confs with less than 100 domains.
-  Huffman encoder failed without specific error on illegal characters
   in a domain
-  Fixed huge memory leaks in TCP code.
-  Removed further file descriptor leaks in guardian respawning code
-  Pipebackend was too chatty.
-  pdns\_server neglected to close fds 0, 1 & 2 when daemonizing

Feature enhancements

-  **pdns\_server ^^list-modules** lists all available modules.

Performance enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  TCP code now only creates a new database connection for AXFR.
-  TCP connections timeout rather quickly now, leading to less load on
   the server.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

Version 1.99.4 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

A lot of new named.confs can now be parsed, zone2sql & bindbackend have
gained features and stability.

Major bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Label compression was not always enabled, leading to large reply
   packets sometimes.
-  Database errors on TCP server lead to a nameserver reload by the
   guardian.
-  MySQL backend neglected to close its connection properly.
-  BindParser miss parsed some IP addresses and netmasks.
-  Truncated answers were also truncated on the packetcache, leading to
   truncated TCP answers.

Feature enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Zone2sql and the bindbackend now understand the Bind $GENERATE{}
   syntax.
-  Zone2sql can optionally gloss over non-existing zones with
   **^^on-error-resume-next**.
-  Zone2sql and the bindbackend now properly expand @ also on the right
   hand side of records.
-  Zone2sql now sets a default TTL.
-  DNS UPDATEs and NOTIFYs are now logged properly and sent the right
   responses.

Performance enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  'Fancy records' are no longer queried for on ANY queries - this is a
   big speedup.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

-  FreeBSD version does not stop when requested to do so.
-  Zone2sql refuses named.confs with less than 100 domains.
-  Wildcard CNAMEs do not work as they do with bind.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release - gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend, gpgsqlbackend

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.

Version 1.99.3 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

The big news in this release is the BindBackend which is now capable of
parsing many more named.conf Bind configurations. Furthermore, PowerDNS
has successfully parsed very large named.confs with large numbers of
small domains, as well as small numbers of large domains (TLD).

Zone transfers are now also much improved.

Major bugs fixed - zone2sql leaked file descriptors on each domain, used
wrong Bison recursion leading to parser stack overflows. This limited
the amount of domains that could be parsed to 1024. - zone2sql can now
read all known zone files, with the exception of those containing
$GENERATE - Guardian relaunching a child lost two file descriptors -
Don't die on a connection reset by peer during zone transfer. -
Webserver does not crash anymore on ringbuffer resize

Feature enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  AXFR can now be disabled, and re-enabled per IP address
-  ^^help accepts a parameter, will then show only help items with that
   prefix.
-  zone2sql now accepts a ^^zone-name parameter
-  BindBackend maturing - 9500 zones parsed in 3.5 seconds. No longer
   case-sensitive.

Performance enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Implemented RFC-breaking AXFR format (which is the industry
   standard). Zone transfers now zoom along at wire speed (many
   megabits/s).

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

-  FreeBSD version does not stop when requested to do so.
-  BindBackend cannot parse zones with $GENERATE statements.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release

-  gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend, gpgsqlbackend

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.

Version 1.99.2 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

Major bugs fixed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Database backend reload does not hang the daemon anymore
-  Buffer overrun in local socket address initialisation may have caused
   binding problems
-  setuid changed the uid to the gid of the selected user
-  zone2sql doesn't crash (dump core) on invocation anymore. Fixed lots
   of small issues.
-  Don't parse configuration file when creating configuration file. This
   was a problem with reinstalling.

Performance improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  removed a lot of unnecessary gettimeofday calls
-  removed needless select(2) call in case of listening on only one
   address
-  removed 3 useless syscalls in the fast path

Having said that, more work may need to be done. Testing on a 486 saw
packet rates in a simple setup (question/wait/answer/question..) improve
from 200 queries/second to over 400.

Usability improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fixed error checking in init.d script (**show**, **mrtg**)
-  Added 'uptime' to the mrtg output
-  removed further GNUisms from installer and init.d scripts for use on
   FreeBSD
-  Debian package and apt repository, thanks to Wichert Akkerman.
-  FreeBSD /usr/ports, thanks to Peter van Dijk (in progress).

Stability may be an issue as well as performance. This version has a
tendency to log a bit too much which slows the nameserver down a lot.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

-  Decreasing a ringbuffer on the website is a sure way to crash the
   daemon. Zone2sql, while improved, still has problems with a zone in
   the following format

::

    name         IN            A        192.0.2.4
                 IN            A        192.0.2.5

To fix, add 'name' to the second line.

Zone2sql does not close file descriptors.

FreeBSD version does not stop when requested via the init.d script.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release - gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend, gpgsqlbackend - fully
functioning bindbackend - will try to parse named.conf, but probably
fail

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.

Version 1.99.1 Early Access Prerelease
--------------------------------------

This is the first public release of what is going to become PowerDNS
2.0. As such, it is not of production quality. Even PowerDNS-the-company
does not run this yet.

Stability may be an issue as well as performance. This version has a
tendency to log a bit too much which slows the nameserver down a lot.

Known bugs
^^^^^^^^^^

Decreasing a ringbuffer on the website is a sure way to crash the
daemon. Zone2sql is very buggy.

Missing features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features present in this document, but disabled or withheld from the
current release:

-  gmysqlbackend, oraclebackend, gpgsqlbackend
-  fully functioning bindbackend - will not parse configuration files

Some of these features will be present in newer releases.
