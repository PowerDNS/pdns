Changelogs for 4.0.x
====================

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.0.9
-----------------------------------

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.0.0
-----------------------------------

Released July 11th 2016

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.0.0 is part of `the great 4.x "Spring
Cleaning" <https://blog.powerdns.com/2015/11/28/powerdns-spring-cleaning/>`__
of PowerDNS which lasted through the end of 2015.

As part of the general cleanup and improvements, we did the following:

-  Moved to C++ 2011, a cleaner more powerful version of C++ that has
   allowed us to `improve the quality of
   implementation <http://bert-hubert.blogspot.nl/2015/01/on-c2011-quality-of-implementation.html>`__
   in many places.
-  Implemented dedicated infrastructure for dealing with DNS names that
   is fully "DNS Native" and needs less escaping and unescaping.
-  All backends derived from the Generic SQL backend use :doc:`prepared
   statements <../backends/generic-sql>`.
-  Both the server and ``pdns_control`` do the right thing when
   ``chroot``'ed.

In addition to this cleanup, 4.0.0 brings the following new features:

-  A revived ODBC backend
   (:doc:`godbc <../backends/generic-odbc>`).
-  A revived LDAP backend (:doc:`ldap <../backends/ldap>`).
-  Support for
   :doc:`CDS/CDNSKEY <../guides/kskrollcdnskey>`
   and :rfc:`7344` key-rollovers.
-  Support for the :doc:`ALIAS <../guides/alias>` record.
-  The webserver and API are no longer marked experimental.

   -  The API-path has moved to ``/api/v1``

-  DNSUpdate is no longer experimental.
-  Default ECDSA (algorithms 13 and 14) support without external
   dependencies.
-  Experimental support for ed25519 DNSSEC signatures (when compiled
   with libsodium support).
-  IXFR consumption support.
-  Many new ``pdnsutil`` commands

   -  ``help`` command now produces the help
   -  Warns if the configuration file cannot be read
   -  Does not check disabled records with ``check-zone`` unless verbose
      mode is enabled
   -  ``create-zone`` command creates a new zone
   -  ``add-record`` command to add records
   -  ``delete-rrset`` and ``replace-rrset`` commands to delete and add
      rrsets
   -  ``edit-zone`` command that spawns ``$EDITOR`` with the zone
      contents in zonefile format regardless of the backend used
      (`blogpost <https://blog.powerdns.com/2016/02/02/powerdns-authoritative-the-new-old-way-to-manage-domains/>`__

The following backend have been dropped in 4.0.0:

-  LMDB.
-  Geo (use the improved :doc:`GeoIP <../backends/geoip>`
   instead).

Important changes:

-  ``pdnssec`` has been renamed to ``pdnsutil``
-  PowerDNS Authoritative Server now listens by default on all IPv6
   addresses.
-  The default for ``pdnsutil secure-zone`` has been changed from 1 2048
   bit RSA KSK and 1 1024 bit RSA ZSK to a single 256 bit ECDSA
   (algorithm 13, ECDSAP256SHA256) key.
-  Several superfluous queries have been dropped from the SQL backend,
