Changelogs for 4.8.x
====================

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.8.0-beta1
  :released: 4th of May 2023

  This is release 4.8.0-beta1 of the Authoritative Server.

  In 4.8, the LMDB backend gains a new Lightning Stream-compatible schema, which requires a data migration (this is automatic, and there is no migration back to the old schema).
  LMDB backend users should pay extra attention to the :doc:`Upgrade Notes <../upgrading>`.

  `Lightning Stream <https://doc.powerdns.com/lightningstream>`_ is an `open source <https://github.com/PowerDNS/lightningstream>`_ data syncer that allows multiple nodes to sync LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database) data to and from an S3 (compatible) bucket. This has particular advantages in distributed and/or large-scale applications (i.e. ~1 million records), making DNS replication much, much easier to manage.

  We are excited about how Lightning Stream simplifies running multiple distributed PowerDNS Authoritative servers, with full support for keeping record data and DNSSEC keys in sync, from multiple writers.

  4.8.0-beta1 adds logic to deal with domains existing twice in the database when two Lightning Stream nodes manage to add it at the same time. It also contains a few other fixes, please see the list below.
