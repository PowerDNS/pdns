.. changelog::
  :version: 4.8.0
  :released: 1st of June 2023

  This is release 4.8.0 of the Authoritative Server.

  Please review the :doc:`Upgrade Notes <../upgrading>` before upgrading from versions < 4.8.x.

  In 4.8, the LMDB backend gains a new Lightning Stream-compatible schema, which requires a data migration (this is automatic, and there is no migration back to the old schema).
  LMDB backend users should pay extra attention to the :doc:`Upgrade Notes <../upgrading>`.

  `Lightning Stream <https://doc.powerdns.com/lightningstream>`_ is an `open source <https://github.com/PowerDNS/lightningstream>`_ data syncer that allows multiple nodes to sync LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database) data to and from an S3 (compatible) bucket. This has particular advantages in distributed and/or large-scale applications (i.e. ~1 million records), making DNS replication much, much easier to manage.

  We are excited about how Lightning Stream simplifies running multiple distributed PowerDNS Authoritative servers, with full support for keeping record data and DNSSEC keys in sync, from multiple writers.

  4.8.0 improves the handling of accidental duplicate domains -- deleting a zone now deletes all versions of it.
  This release also contains a few other fixes, please see the list below.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 12869
