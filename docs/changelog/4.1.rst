.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0
  :released: 30th of November 2017

  This is the first release in the 4.1 train.

  The full release notes can be read `on the blog <https://blog.powerdns.com/2017/11/30/powerdns-authoritative-server-4-1/>`_.

  The 4.1 release is a major upgrade for the Authoritative Server featuring many improvements and speedups:

  - Improved performance: 400% speedup in some scenarios,
  - Crypto API: DNSSEC fully configurable via RESTful API,
  - Improved documentation,
  - Database related improvements,
  - Enhanced tooling,
  - Support for TCP Fast Open,
  - Support for non-local bind,
  - Support for Botan 2.x (and removal of support for Botan 1.10),
  - Our packages now ship with PKCS #11 support.

  Recursor passthrough removal: This will impact many installations, and we realize this may be painful, but it is necessary. Previously, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server contained a facility for sending recursion desired queries to a resolving backend, possibly after first consulting its local cache. This feature (‘recursor=’) was frequently confusing and also delivered inconsistent results, for example when a query ended up referring to a CNAME that was outside of the Authoritative Server’s knowledge. To read more about this please see the blog post mentioned above or read the :doc:`migration guide <../../guides/recursion>`.

  Changes since 4.1.0-rc3:

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5968

    Fix hang when PATCHing zone during rectify.

  .. change::

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc3
  :released: 17th of November 2017

  This is the third release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  This release features various bug fixes and some improvements to
  ``pdnsutil``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5905

    Use 302 redirects in the webserver for ringbuffer reset or
    resize. With the current 301 redirect it is only possible to reset
    or resize once. Every next duplicate action is replaced by the
    destination cached in the browser.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5884
    :tickets: 5849

    Fix messages created by ``pdnsutil generate-tsig-key``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5917

    Use ``_exit()`` when we really really want to exit, for example
    after a fatal error. This stops us dying while we die. A call to
    ``exit()`` will trigger destructors, which may paradoxically stop
    the process from exiting, taking down only one thread, but harming
    the rest of the process.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, New Features
    :pullreq: 5883
    :tickets: 5853

    Add ``add-meta`` command to ``pdnsutil`` that can be used to append

    :pullreq: 5928
    :tickets: 5903

    Warn if records in a zone are occluded.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5935

    Throw exception for metadata endpoint with wrong zone. Before, We
    would happily accept this POST.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, New Features
    :pullreq: 5936
    :tickets: 5909, 5910

    Make it possible to disable DNSSEC via the API, this is equivalent
    to doing ``pdnsutil disable-dnssec``.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc2
  :released: 3rd of November 2017

    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5678

    Treat requestor's payload size lower than 512 as equal to 512.
    Before, we did not follow :rfc:`RFC 6891 section 6.2.3 <6891#section-6.2.3>` correctly.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements, LDAP
    :pullreq: 5584

    and after the changes.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5710
    :tickets: 5692

    Fix a crash when getting a public GOST key if the private one is not set.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5766
    :tickets: 5767

    Correctly purge entries from the caches after a transfer.  Since the
    QC/PC split up, we only removed entries for the AXFR'd domain from
    the packet cache, not the query cache.
    We also did not remove entries in case of IXFR.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5791

    When throwing because of bogus content in the tinydns database,
    report the offending name+type so the admin can find the offending

    Specifically, where we previously used the SOA minimum field for the default
    TTL if none was set explictly, or no $TTL was set, we now use the TTL from
    the previous line.
