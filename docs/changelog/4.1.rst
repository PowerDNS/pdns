Changelogs for 4.1.x
====================

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc3
  :released: 17th of November 2017

  This is the third release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  This release features various bug fixes and some improvements to
  ``pdnsutil``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5905

    Use 302 redirects in the webserver for ringbuffer reset or
    resize. With the current 301 redirect it is only possible to reset
    or resize once. Every next duplicate action is replaced by the
    destination cached in the browser.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5884
    :tickets: 5849

    Fix messages created by ``pdnsutil generate-tsig-key``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5616

    Better support for deleting entries in NetmaskTree and NetmaskGroup.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5917

    Use ``_exit()`` when we really really want to exit, for example
    after a fatal error. This stops us dying while we die. A call to
    ``exit()`` will trigger destructors, which may paradoxically stop
    the process from exiting, taking down only one thread, but harming
    the rest of the process.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, New Features
    :pullreq: 5883
    :tickets: 5853

    Add ``add-meta`` command to ``pdnsutil`` that can be used to append
    to existing metadata without clobbering it.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5928
    :tickets: 5903

    Add back missing output details to rectifyZone.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5879
    :tickets: 3059, 5948, 5949

    Warn if records in a zone are occluded.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5938

    Don't crash when asked to run with zero threads.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5935

    Throw exception for metadata endpoint with wrong zone. Before, We
    would happily accept this POST.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, New Features
    :pullreq: 5936
    :tickets: 5909, 5910

    Make it possible to disable DNSSEC via the API, this is equivalent
    to doing ``pdnsutil disable-dnssec``.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc2
  :released: 3rd of November 2017

  This is the second release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  This release has several performance improvements, stability and
  correctness fixes.

  .. change::
    :tags: Packages, New Features
    :pullreq: 5665

    :tickets: 5673

    Improve trailing dot handling internally which lead to a segfault in
    pdnsutil before.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5678

    Treat requestor's payload size lower than 512 as equal to 512.
    Before, we did not follow :rfc:`RFC 6891 section 6.2.3 <6891#section-6.2.3>` correctly.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements, LDAP
    :pullreq: 5584

    Add support for new record types to the LDAP backend.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5696

    For zone PATCH requests, add new ``X-PDNS-Old-Serial`` and
    ``X-PDNS-New-Serial`` response headers with the zone serials before
    and after the changes.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5710
    :tickets: 5692

    Remove "" around secpoll result which fixes ``pdns_control show
    security-status`` not working.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, BIND
    :pullreq: 5702

    Make bindbackend startTransaction to return false when it has
    failed. (Aki Tuomi)

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC, API
    :pullreq: 5704

    :tags: Bug Fixes, Tools
    :pullreq: 5729
    :tickets: 5719

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC
    :pullreq: 5722
    :tickets: 5721

    Make the auth also publish CDS/CDNSKEY records for inactive keys, as
    this is needed to roll without double sigs.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC
    :pullreq: 5734

    Fix a crash when getting a public GOST key if the private one is not set.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5766
    :tickets: 5767

    Correctly purge entries from the caches after a transfer.  Since the
    QC/PC split up, we only removed entries for the AXFR'd domain from
    the packet cache, not the query cache.
    We also did not remove entries in case of IXFR.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5791

    When throwing because of bogus content in the tinydns database,
    report the offending name+type so the admin can find the offending
    record.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5815

    Rectify zones via the API. (Nils Wisiol)

    * Move the pdnsutil rectification code to the DNSSECKeeper
    * Generate DNSSEC keys for a zone when "dnssec" is true in an API POST/PATCH for zones
    * Rectify DNSSEC zones after POST/PATCH when API-RECTIFY metadata is 1
    * Allow setting this metadata via the "api-rectify" param in a Zone object
    * Show "nsec3param" and "nsec3narrow" in Zone API responses
    * Add an "rrsets" request parameter for a zone to skip sending RRSets in the response
    * Add rectify endpoint in the API

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 5842

    Add :ref:`log-timestamp` option. This option can be used to disable
    printing timestamps to stdout, this is useful when using
    systemd-journald or another supervisor that timestamps stdout by
    itself. As the logs will not have 2 timestamps.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5498
    :tickets: 2250, 5734, 5797, 5889

    :tickets: 5115, 5807

    Fix issues when b2b-migrating from the BIND backend to a database:

    * No masters were set in the target db (#5807)
    * Only the last master in the list of masters would be added to the target database
    * The BIND backend was not fully aware of native zones

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc1
  :released: 31st of August 2017

  This is the first release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  .. change::
    :tags: BIND, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5094

    Make the zone parser adhere to :rfc:`2308` with regards to implicit TTLs.

    Existing zone files may now be interpreted differently.
    Specifically, where we previously used the SOA minimum field for the default
    TTL if none was set explictly, or no $TTL was set, we now use the TTL from
    the previous line.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 4373

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 4467, 4492
