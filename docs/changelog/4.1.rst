.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0
  :released: 30th of November 2017

  This is the first release in the 4.1 train.

  The full release notes can be read `on the blog <https://blog.powerdns.com/2017/11/30/powerdns-authoritative-server-4-1/>`_.

  The 4.1 release is a major upgrade for the Authoritative Server featuring many improvements and speedups:

  - Improved performance: 400% speedup in some scenarios,
  - Crypto API: DNSSEC fully configurable via RESTful API,
  - Improved documentation,
  - Database related improvements,
  - Enhanced tooling,
  - Support for TCP Fast Open,
  - Support for non-local bind,
  - Support for Botan 2.x (and removal of support for Botan 1.10),
  - Our packages now ship with PKCS #11 support.

  Recursor passthrough removal: This will impact many installations, and we realize this may be painful, but it is necessary. Previously, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server contained a facility for sending recursion desired queries to a resolving backend, possibly after first consulting its local cache. This feature (‚Äòrecursor=‚Äô) was frequently confusing and also delivered inconsistent results, for example when a query ended up referring to a CNAME that was outside of the Authoritative Server‚Äôs knowledge. To read more about this please see the blog post mentioned above or read the :doc:`migration guide <../../guides/recursion>`.

  Changes since 4.1.0-rc3:

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5968

    Fix hang when PATCHing zone during rectify.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 5976
    :tickets: 5974

    Report remote IP when SOA query comes back with empty question section.

  .. change::
    :tags: Removed Features
    :pullreq: 6004

    Remove deprecated SOA-EDIT values: INCEPTION and INCEPTION-WEEK.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 6007

    Deny cache flush, zone retrieve and notify if the API is read-only.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc3
  :released: 17th of November 2017

  This is the third release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  This release features various bug fixes and some improvements to
  ``pdnsutil``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5905

    Use 302 redirects in the webserver for ringbuffer reset or
    resize. With the current 301 redirect it is only possible to reset
    or resize once. Every next duplicate action is replaced by the
    destination cached in the browser.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5884
    :tickets: 5849

    Fix messages created by ``pdnsutil generate-tsig-key``.

    Better support for deleting entries in NetmaskTree and NetmaskGroup.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5917

    Use ``_exit()`` when we really really want to exit, for example
    after a fatal error. This stops us dying while we die. A call to
    ``exit()`` will trigger destructors, which may paradoxically stop
    the process from exiting, taking down only one thread, but harming
    the rest of the process.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, New Features
    :pullreq: 5883
    :tickets: 5853

    Add ``add-meta`` command to ``pdnsutil`` that can be used to append
    to existing metadata without clobbering it.

  .. change::
    :tags: Tools, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5928
    :tickets: 5903

    :tags: Tools, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5879
    :tickets: 3059, 5948, 5949

    Warn if records in a zone are occluded.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5935

    Throw exception for metadata endpoint with wrong zone. Before, We
    would happily accept this POST.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, New Features
    :pullreq: 5936
    :tickets: 5909, 5910

    Make it possible to disable DNSSEC via the API, this is equivalent
    to doing ``pdnsutil disable-dnssec``.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc2
  :released: 3rd of November 2017

  This is the second release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  This release has several performance improvements, stability and
  correctness fixes.

  .. change::
    :tags: Packages, New Features
    :pullreq: 5665

    Add :doc:`PKCS#11 <../../dnssec/pkcs11>` support to packages on Operating Systems that support it.

    :tickets: 5673

    Improve trailing dot handling internally which lead to a segfault in
    pdnsutil before.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5678

    Treat requestor's payload size lower than 512 as equal to 512.
    Before, we did not follow :rfc:`RFC 6891 section 6.2.3 <6891#section-6.2.3>` correctly.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements, LDAP
    :pullreq: 5584

    Add support for new record types to the LDAP backend.

  .. change::
    :tags: API, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5696

    ``X-PDNS-New-Serial`` response headers with the zone serials before
    and after the changes.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5710
    :tickets: 5692

    Remove "" around secpoll result which fixes ``pdns_control show
    security-status`` not working.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, BIND
    :pullreq: 5702

    Make bindbackend startTransaction to return false when it has
    failed. (Aki Tuomi)

    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC, API
    :pullreq: 5704

    Make default options singular and use defaults in Cryptokey API-endpoint

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC
    :pullreq: 5722
    :tickets: 5721

    Make the auth also publish CDS/CDNSKEY records for inactive keys, as
    this is needed to roll without double sigs.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, DNSSEC
    :pullreq: 5734

    Fix a crash when getting a public GOST key if the private one is not set.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5766
    :tickets: 5767

    Correctly purge entries from the caches after a transfer.  Since the
    QC/PC split up, we only removed entries for the AXFR'd domain from
    the packet cache, not the query cache.
    We also did not remove entries in case of IXFR.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes, Internals
    :pullreq: 5791

    When throwing because of bogus content in the tinydns database,
    report the offending name+type so the admin can find the offending
    record.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5815

    Rectify zones via the API. (Nils Wisiol)

    * Move the pdnsutil rectification code to the DNSSECKeeper
    * Generate DNSSEC keys for a zone when "dnssec" is true in an API POST/PATCH for zones
    * Rectify DNSSEC zones after POST/PATCH when API-RECTIFY metadata is 1
    * Allow setting this metadata via the "api-rectify" param in a Zone object
    * Show "nsec3param" and "nsec3narrow" in Zone API responses
    * Add an "rrsets" request parameter for a zone to skip sending RRSets in the response
    * Add rectify endpoint in the API

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 5842

    Add :ref:`setting-log-timestamp` option. This option can be used to disable
    printing timestamps to stdout, this is useful when using
    systemd-journald or another supervisor that timestamps stdout by
    itself. As the logs will not have 2 timestamps.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5498
    :tickets: 2250, 5734, 5797, 5889

    Fix issues when b2b-migrating from the BIND backend to a database:

    * No masters were set in the target db (#5807)
    * Only the last master in the list of masters would be added to the target database
    * The BIND backend was not fully aware of native zones

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc1
  :released: 31st of August 2017

  This is the first release candidate of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server in the 4.1 release train.

  .. change::
    :tags: BIND, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5094

    Make the zone parser adhere to :rfc:`2308` with regards to implicit TTLs.

    Existing zone files may now be interpreted differently.
    Specifically, where we previously used the SOA minimum field for the default
    TTL if none was set explictly, or no $TTL was set, we now use the TTL from
    the previous line.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
