====================

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.3.0-rc2
  :released: 18th of March 2020

  This is the first Release Candidate for version 4.3.0 of the Authoritative Server.

  Please see :doc:`the upgrade notes <../upgrading>` for some breaking changes including a mandatory schema upgrade for database backends.
