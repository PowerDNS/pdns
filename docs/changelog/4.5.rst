Changelogs for 4.5.x
====================

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.5.0-rc1
  :released: 25th of June 2021

  This is the first release candidate for version 4.5.0 of the Authoritative Server.
  This release contains a ton of improvements and bug fixes compared to 4.4, but very few user visible changes.

  The one notable feature is the 'zone cache', which allows PowerDNS to keep a list of zones in memory, updated periodically.
  With this cache, PowerDNS can avoid hitting the database with queries for unknown domains.
  In some setups, and some attack scenarios, this can make a serious performance difference.

  Since 4.5.0-beta1, the zone cache is enabled by default.

  Please make sure to read the :doc:`upgrade notes <../upgrading>` before upgrading.
