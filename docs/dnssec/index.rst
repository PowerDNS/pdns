DNSSEC
======

PowerDNS contains support for DNSSEC, enabling the easy serving of
DNSSEC secured data, with minimal administrative overhead.

In PowerDNS, DNS and signatures and keys are (usually) treated as
separate entities. The domain & record storage is thus almost completely
devoid of DNSSEC record types.

Instead, keying material is stored separately, allowing operators to
focus on the already complicated task of keeping DNS data correct. In
practice, DNSSEC related material is often stored within the same
database, but within separate tables.

If a DNSSEC configuration is found for a domain, the PowerDNS daemon
will provide key records, signatures and (hashed) denials of existence
automatically.

As an example, securing an existing zone can be as simple as:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pdnsutil secure-zone powerdnssec.org

Alternatively, PowerDNS can serve pre-signed zones, without knowledge of
private keys.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2
