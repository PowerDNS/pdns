pdnsutil
========

Synopsis
--------

pdnsutil [OPTION]... *COMMAND*

Description
-----------

:program:`pdnsutil` (formerly pdnssec) is a powerful command that is the
operator-friendly gateway into DNSSEC and zone management for PowerDNS.
Behind the scenes, :program:`pdnsutil` manipulates a PowerDNS backend database,
which also means that for many databases, :program:`pdnsutil` can be run
remotely, and can configure key material on different servers.

Options
-------

-h, --help              Show summary of options
-v, --verbose           Be more verbose
-f, --force             Force an action
-q, --quiet             Be quiet
--config-name <NAME>    Virtual configuration name
--config-dir <DIR>      Location of pdns.conf. Default is /etc/powerdns.

Commands
--------

There are many available commands, this section splits them up into
their respective uses.

DNSSEC-RELATED COMMANDS
-----------------------

Several commands manipulate the DNSSEC keys and options for zones. Some
of these commands require an *ALGORITHM* to be set. The following
algorithms are supported:

-  rsasha1
-  rsasha1-nsec3-sha1
-  rsasha256
-  rsasha512
-  ecdsa256
-  ecdsa384
-  ed25519
-  ed448

.. note::
  ed25519 and ed448 algorithms will only be available if adequate cryptographic
  libraries have been available while compiling PowerDNS on your particular
  system.

In addition to the algorithm, some commands below may ask for a key size in
bits. The key size may be omitted for the ECC algorithms, which support only
one valid size per algorithm; for ECDSA256 and ED25519, it is 256;
for ECDSA384, it is 384; and for ED448, it is... 456.

activate-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Activate a key with id *KEY_ID* within a zone called *ZONE*.

add-zone-key *ZONE* [**KSK**,\ **ZSK**] [**active**,\ **inactive**] [**published**,\ **unpublished**] *ALGORITHM* [*KEYBITS*]

    Create a new key for zone *ZONE*, and make it a KSK (default) or a ZSK, with
    the specified *ALGORITHM* and *KEYBITS*. If *KEYBITS* is omitted, the value
    of :ref:`setting-default-ksk-size` or :ref:`setting-default-zsk-size` are
    used.
    
    The key is inactive by default, set it to **active** to immediately use it
    to sign *ZONE*. The key is published in the zone by default, set it to
    **unpublished** to keep it from being returned in a DNSKEY query, which is
    useful for algorithm rollovers.
    
    Prints the id of the added key.

create-bind-db *FILENAME*

    Create DNSSEC database (sqlite3) at *FILENAME* for the BIND backend.
    Remember to set ``bind-dnssec-db=*FILE*`` in your ``pdns.conf``.

deactivate-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Deactivate a key with id KEY_ID within a zone called *ZONE*.

disable-dnssec *ZONE*

    Deactivate all keys and unset PRESIGNED in *ZONE*.

export-zone-dnskey *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Export DNSKEY and DS of key with key id *KEY_ID* within zone *ZONE* to
    standard output.

export-zone-ds *ZONE*

    Export all KSK DS records for *ZONE* to standard output.

export-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Export full (private) key with key id *KEY_ID* within zone *ZONE* to
    standard output. The format used is compatible with BIND and NSD/LDNS.

export-zone-key-pem *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Export full (private) key with key id *KEY_ID* within zone *ZONE* to
    standard output in the PEM file format. The format is compatible with
    many non-DNS software products.

generate-zone-key {**KSK**,\ **ZSK**} [*ALGORITHM*] [*KEYBITS*]

    Generate a ZSK or KSK with specified algorithm and bits and print it
    on standard output. If *ALGORITHM* is not set, ECDSA256 is used.
    If *KEYBITS* is not set, an appropriate keysize is selected
    for *ALGORITHM*: for RSA keys, 2048 bits for KSK and 1024 bits for ZSK;
    for ECC keys, the algorithm-required size as mentioned above.

import-zone-key *ZONE* *FILE* [**KSK**,\ **ZSK**] [**active**,\ **inactive**] [**published**,\ **unpublished**]

    Import from *FILE* a full (private) key for the zone *ZONE*. The
    format used is compatible with BIND and NSD/LDNS. **KSK** or **ZSK**
    specifies the flags this key should have on import. Defaults to KSK,
    active and published. Prints the id of the added key.

import-zone-key-pem *ZONE* *FILE* *ALGORITHM* {**KSK**,\ **ZSK**}

    Import from PEM *FILE* a full (private) key for the zone *ZONE* with a
    specified *ALGORITHM*. The format used is compatible with many non-DNS
    software products. **KSK** or **ZSK** specifies the flags this key should
    have on import. Prints the id of the added key.

publish-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Publish the key with id *KEY_ID* within zone *ZONE*.

remove-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Remove a key with id *KEY_ID* from zone *ZONE*.

set-nsec3 *ZONE* ['*HASH-ALGORITHM* *FLAGS* *ITERATIONS* *SALT*'] [**narrow**]

    Sets NSEC3 parameters for this zone. The quoted parameters are 4
    values that are used for the NSEC3PARAM record and decide how
    NSEC3 records are created. The NSEC3 parameters must be quoted on
    the command line. *HASH-ALGORITHM* must be 1 (SHA-1). Setting
    *FLAGS* to 1 enables NSEC3 opt-out operation. Only do this if you
    know you need it. For *ITERATIONS*, please consult
    :rfc:`RFC 5155<5155#section-10.3>`.

    And be aware that a high number might overload validating
    resolvers and that a limit can be set with ``max-nsec3-iterations``
    in ``pdns.conf``. The *SALT* is a hexadecimal string encoding the bits
    for the salt, or - to use no salt.
    
    Setting **narrow** will make PowerDNS send out "white lies" (:rfc:`7129`)
    about the next secure record to prevent zone enumeration. Instead of
    looking it up in the database, it will send out the hash + 1 as the next
    secure record. Narrow mode requires online signing capabilities by the
    nameserver and therefore zone transfers are denied.
    
    If only the zone is provided as argument, the 4-parameter quoted string
    defaults to ``'1 0 0 -'``, as recommended by :rfc:`9276`.
    
    A sample commandline would be:

    ``pdnsutil set-nsec3 powerdnssec.org '1 1 1 ab' narrow``

    **WARNING**: If running in RSASHA1 mode (algorithm 5 or 7), switching
    from NSEC to NSEC3 will require a DS update in the parent zone.

unpublish-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY_ID*

    Unpublish the key with id *KEY_ID* within zone *ZONE*.

unset-nsec3 *ZONE*

    Converts *ZONE* to NSEC operations. **WARNING**: If running in
    RSASHA1 mode (algorithm 5 or 7), switching from NSEC to NSEC3 will
    require a DS update at the parent zone!

set-publish-cds *ZONE* [*DIGESTALGOS*]

    Set *ZONE* to respond to queries for its CDS records. the optional
    argument *DIGESTALGOS* should be a comma-separated list of DS
    algorithms to use. By default, this is 2 (SHA-256). 0 will publish a
    CDS with a DNSSEC delete algorithm.

set-publish-cdnskey *ZONE* [**delete**]

    Set *ZONE* to publish CDNSKEY records. Add 'delete' to publish a CDNSKEY
    with a DNSSEC delete algorithm.

unset-publish-cds *ZONE*

    Set *ZONE* to stop responding to queries for its CDS records.

unset-publish-cdnskey *ZONE*

    Set *ZONE* to stop publishing CDNSKEY records.

TSIG RELATED COMMANDS

-  hmac-sha384
-  hmac-sha512

    (secondary/consumer) zone metadata.

deactivate-tsig-key *ZONE* *NAME* {**primary**,\ **secondary**,\ **producer**,\ **consumer**}

    **EDITOR** is empty, *pdnsutil* falls back to using *editor*.

hash-password [*WORK_FACTOR*]

    This convenience command reads a password (not echoed) from standard
    input and returns a hashed and salted version, for use as a webserver
    password or api key.
    An optional scrypt work factor can be specified, in powers of two,
    otherwise it defaults to 1024.

hash-zone-record *ZONE* *RNAME*

    This convenience command hashes the name *RNAME* according to the

secure-all-zones [**increase-serial**]

    Configures all zones that are not currently signed with reasonable
    DNSSEC settings. Setting **increase-serial** will increase the
    serial of those zones too. You should manually run 'pdnsutil
