# NAME
pdnssec - PowerDNS dnssec command and control

# SYNOPSIS
pdnssec [OPTION]... *COMMAND*

# DESCRIPTION
**pdnssec** is a powerful command that is the operator-friendly gateway into
PowerDNSSEC configuration. Behind the scenes, **pdnssec** manipulates a PowerDNS
backend database, which also means that for many databases, **pdnssec** can be
run remotely, and can configure key material on different servers.

# OPTIONS
-h | -help
:    Show summary of options

-v | --verbose
:    Be more verbose.

--force
:    force an action

--config-name *NAME*
:    Virtual configuration name

--config-dir *DIR*
:    Location of pdns.conf. Default is /etc/powerdns.

# COMMANDS
There are many available commands, this section splits them up into their
respective uses

## DNSSEC RELATED COMMANDS
Several commands manipulate the DNSSEC keys and options for zones. Some of these
commands require an *ALGORITHM* to be set. The following algorithms are
supported:

 * rsasha1
 * rsasha256
 * rsasha512
 * gost
 * ecdsa256
 * ecdsa384

activate-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY-ID*
:    Activate a key with id *KEY-ID* within a zone called *ZONE*.

add-zone-key *ZONE* {**KSK**,**ZSK**} [**active**,**passive**] *KEYBITS* *ALGORITHM*
:   Create a new key for zone *ZONE*, and make it a KSK or a ZSK, with the
    specified algorithm. The key is passive by default, set it to **active** to
    immediately use it to sign *ZONE*.

create-bind-db *FILE*
:    Create DNSSEC database (sqlite3) at *FILE* for the BIND backend.
     Remember to set `bind-dnssec-db=*FILE*` in your `pdns.conf`.

deactivate-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY-ID*
:    Deactivate a key with id KEY-ID within a zone called *ZONE*.

disable-dnssec *ZONE*
:    Deactivate all keys and unset PRESIGNED in *ZONE*.

export-zone-dnskey *ZONE* *KEY-ID*
:    Export to standard output DNSKEY and DS of key with key id *KEY-ID* within
     zone called *ZONE*.

export-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY-ID*
:    Export to standard output full (private) key with key id *KEY-ID* within
     zone called *ZONE*. The format used is compatible with BIND and NSD/LDNS.

generate-zone-key {**KSK**,**ZSK**} [*ALGORITHM*] [*KEYBITS*]
:    Generate a ZSK or KSK to stdout with specified algorithm and bits and print
     it on STDOUT. If *ALGORITHM* is not set, RSASHA512 is used. If *KEYBITS* is
     not set, an appropriate keysize is selected for *ALGORITHM*.

import-zone-key *ZONE* *FILE* {**KSK**,**ZSK**}
:    Import from *FILE* a full (private) key for zone called *ZONE*. The format
     used is compatible with BIND and NSD/LDNS. **KSK** or **ZSK** specifies the
     flags this key should have on import.

remove-zone-key *ZONE* *KEY-ID*
:    Remove a key with id *KEY-ID* from a zone called *ZONE*.

set-nsec3 *ZONE* '*HASH-ALGORITHM* *FLAGS* *ITERATIONS* *SALT*' [**narrow**]
:    Sets NSEC3 parameters for this zone. The quoted parameters are 4 values
     that are used for the the NSEC3PARAM record and decide how NSEC3 records
     are created. The NSEC3 parameters must be quoted on the command line.

     *HASH-ALGORITHM* must be 1 (SHA-1).

     Setting *FLAGS* to 1 enables NSEC3 opt-out operation. Only do this if you
     know you need it.

     For *ITERATIONS*, please consult RFC 5155, section 10.3. And be aware
     that a high number might overload validating resolvers.

     The *SALT* is a hexadecimal string encoding the bits for the salt.

     Setting **narrow** will make PowerDNS send out "white lies" about the next
     secure record. Instead of looking it up in the database, it will send out
     the hash + 1 as the next secure record.

     A sample commandline is: "pdnssec set-nsec3 powerdnssec.org '1 1 1 ab' narrow".

     **WARNING**: If running in RSASHA1 mode (algorithm 5 or 7), switching from
     NSEC to NSEC3 will require a DS update in the parent zone.

unset-nsec3 *ZONE*
:    Converts *ZONE* to NSEC operations. **WARNING**: If running in RSASHA1 mode
     (algorithm 5 or 7), switching from NSEC to NSEC3 will require a DS update
     at the parent zone!

## TSIG RELATED COMMANDS
These commands manipulate TSIG key information in the database. Some commands
require an *ALGORITHM*, the following are available:

 * hmac-md5
 * hmac-sha1
 * hmac-sha224
 * hmac-sha256
 * hmac-sha384
 * hmac-sha512

activate-tsig-key *ZONE* *NAME* {**master**,**slave**}
:    Enable TSIG key *NAME* for zone *ZONE*.

deactivate-tsig-key *ZONE* *NAME* {**master**,**slave**}
:    Disable TSIG key *NAME* for zone *ZONE*.

delete-tsig-key *NAME*
:    Delete the TSIG key *NAME*. Warning, this does not deactivate said key.

generate-tsig-key *NAME* *ALGORITHM*
:    Generate new TSIG key with name *NAME* and the specified algorithm.

## ZONE MANIPULATION COMMANDS
create-zone *ZONE*
:    Create an empty zone named *ZONE*.

check-all-zones
:    Check all zones for correctness.

check-zone *ZONE*
:    Check zone *ZONE* for correctness.

delete-zone *ZONE*:
:    Delete the zone named *ZONE*.

get-meta *ZONE* [*ATTRIBUTE*]...
:    Get zone metadata. If no *ATTRIBUTE* given, lists all known.

hash-zone-record *ZONE* *RNAME*
:    This convenience command hashes the name *RNAME* according to the NSEC3
     settings of *ZONE*. Refuses to hash for zones with no NSEC3 settings.

list-all-zones:
:    List all zone names.

list-zone *ZONE*
:    Show all records for *ZONE*.

load-zone *ZONE* *FILE*
:    Load records for *ZONE* from *FILE*. If *ZONE* already exists, all records
     are overwritten, this operation is atomic. If *ZONE* doesn't exist, it is
     created.

rectify-zone *ZONE*
:    Calculates the 'ordername' and 'auth' fields for a zone called *ZONE* so
     they comply with DNSSEC settings. Can be used to fix up migrated data. Can
     always safely be run, it does no harm.

secure-zone *ZONE*
:    Configures a zone called *ZONE* with reasonable DNSSEC settings. You should
     manually run 'pdnssec rectify-zone' afterwards.

set-meta *ZONE* *ATTRIBUTE* [*VALUE*]
:    Set domainmetadata *ATTRIBUTE* for *ZONE* to *VALUE*. An empty value clears it.

set-presigned *ZONE*
:    Switches *ZONE* to presigned operation, utilizing in-zone RRSIGs.

show-zone *ZONE*
:    Shows all DNSSEC related settings of a zone called *ZONE*.

test-schema *ZONE*
:    Test database schema, this creates the zone *ZONE*

unset-presigned *ZONE*
:    Disables presigned operation for *ZONE*.
