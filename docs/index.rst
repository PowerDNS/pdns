PowerDNS Authoritative Nameserver
=================================

The PowerDNS Authoritative Server is a versatile nameserver which
supports a large number of backends. These backends can either be plain
zone files or be more dynamic in nature.

PowerDNS has the concepts of 'backends'. A backend is a datastore that
the server will consult that contains DNS records (and some metadata).
The backends range from database backends (:doc:`MySQL <backends/generic-mysql>`, :doc:`PostgreSQL <backends/generic-postgresql>`, :doc:`Oracle <backends/oracle>`)
and :doc:`BIND zone files <backends/bind>` to :doc:`co-processes <backends/pipe>` and :doc:`JSON API's <backends/remote>`.

Multiple backends can be enabled in the configuration by using the
:ref:`setting-launch` option. Each backend can be configured separately.

See the :doc:`backend <backends/index>` documentation for more information.

This documentation is also available as a `PDF document <PowerDNS-Authoritative.pdf>`_.

What details should I supply?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Start out with stating what you think should be happening.
Quite often, wrong expectations are the actual problem.
Furthermore, your operating system, which version of PowerDNS you use and where you got it from (RPM, .DEB, tar.bz2).
If you compiled it yourself, what were the ``./configure`` parameters.

If possible, supply the actual name of your domain and the IP address of your server(s).
