This used to be a very silly backend which is still discussed in the
:doc:`Backends writer's guide <../appendices/backend-writers-guide>`.  as a
demonstration on how to write a PowerDNS backend.

This backend knew about only one hostname, and only about its IP
address at that. With every query, a new random IP address was generated.

It only made sense to load the random backend in combination with a
regular backend. This can be done by prepending it to the
:ref:`setting-launch` instruction, such as
``launch=random,gmysql``.
