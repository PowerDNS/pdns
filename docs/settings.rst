Authoritative Server Settings
=============================

All PowerDNS Authoritative Server settings are listed here, excluding
those that originate from backends, which are documented in the relevant
chapters. These settings can be set inside ``pdns.conf`` or on the
commandline when invoking the ``pdns`` binary.

You can use ``+=`` syntax to set some variables incrementally, but this
requires you to have at least one non-incremental setting for the
variable to act as base setting. This is mostly useful for
:ref:`setting-include-dir` directive.

For boolean settings, specifying the name of the setting without a value
means ``yes``.

.. _setting-8bit-dns:

``8bit-dns``
------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Allow 8 bit DNS queries.

.. _setting-allow-axfr-ips:

``allow-axfr-ips``
------------------

-  IP ranges, separated by commas
-  Default: 127.0.0.0/8,::1

If set, only these IP addresses or netmasks will be able to perform
AXFR without TSIG.

.. warning::
   This setting only applies to AXFR without TSIG keys. If you allow a TSIG key to perform an AXFR,
   this setting will not be checked for that transfer, and the client will be able to perform the AXFR
   from everywhere.

.. _setting-allow-dnsupdate-from:

``allow-dnsupdate-from``
------------------------

-  IP ranges, separated by commas
-  Default: 127.0.0.0/8,::1

Allow DNS updates from these IP ranges. Set to empty string to honour ``ALLOW-DNSUPDATE-FROM`` in :ref:`metadata-allow-dnsupdate-from`.

.. _setting-allow-notify-from:

``allow-notify-from``
---------------------

-  IP ranges, separated by commas
-  Default: 0.0.0.0/0,::/0

Allow AXFR NOTIFY from these IP ranges. Setting this to an empty string
will drop all incoming notifies.

.. note::
  IPs allowed by this setting, still go through the normal NOTIFY processing as described in :ref:`secondary-operation`
  The IP the NOTIFY is received from, still needs to be a nameserver for the secondary domain. Explicitly setting this parameter will not bypass those checks.

.. _setting-allow-unsigned-autoprimary:

``allow-unsigned-autoprimary``
------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-allow-unsigned-supermaster` before 4.5.0.

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Turning this off requires all autoprimary notifications to be signed by
valid TSIG signature. It will accept any existing key on slave.

.. _setting-allow-unsigned-notify:

``allow-unsigned-notify``
-------------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Turning this off requires all notifications that are received to be
signed by valid TSIG signature for the zone.

.. _setting-allow-unsigned-supermaster:

``allow-unsigned-supermaster``
------------------------------

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-allow-unsigned-autoprimary`.

.. _setting-also-notify:

``also-notify``
---------------

-  IP addresses, separated by commas

When notifying a zone, also notify these nameservers. Example:
``also-notify=192.0.2.1, 203.0.113.167``. The IP addresses listed in
``also-notify`` always receive a notification. Even if they do not match
the list in :ref:`setting-only-notify`.

You may specify an alternate port by appending :port. Example:
``also-notify=192.0.2.1:5300``. If no port is specified, port 53
is used.

.. _setting-any-to-tcp:

``any-to-tcp``
--------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Answer questions for the ANY on UDP with a truncated packet that refers
the remote server to TCP. Useful for mitigating reflection attacks.

.. _setting-api:

``api``
-------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Enable/disable the :doc:`http-api/index`.

.. _setting-api-key:

``api-key``
-----------

-  String

.. versionchanged:: 4.6.0
  This setting now accepts a hashed and salted version.

Static pre-shared authentication key for access to the REST API. Since 4.6.0 the key can be hashed and salted using ``pdnsutil hash-password`` instead of being stored in the configuration in plaintext, but the plaintext version is still supported.

.. _setting-autosecondary:

``autosecondary``
-----------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-superslave` before 4.5.0.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Turn on autosecondary support. See :ref:`autoprimary-operation`.

.. _setting-axfr-fetch-timeout:

``axfr-fetch-timeout``
----------------------

- Integer
- Default: 10

.. versionadded:: 4.3.0

Maximum time in seconds for inbound AXFR to start or be idle after starting.

.. _setting-axfr-lower-serial:

``axfr-lower-serial``
---------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Also AXFR a zone from a master with a lower serial.

.. _setting-cache-ttl:

``cache-ttl``
-------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 20

Seconds to store packets in the :ref:`packet-cache`. A value of 0 will disable the cache.

.. _setting-carbon-instance:

``carbon-instance``
-------------------

-  String
-  Default: auth

Set the instance or third string of the metric key. Be careful not to include
any dots in this setting, unless you know what you are doing.
See :ref:`metricscarbon`

.. _setting-carbon-interval:

``carbon-interval``
-------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 30

If sending carbon updates, this is the interval between them in seconds.
See :ref:`metricscarbon`.

.. _setting-carbon-namespace:

``carbon-namespace``
--------------------

-  String
-  Default: pdns

Set the namespace or first string of the metric key. Be careful not to include
any dots in this setting, unless you know what you are doing.
See :ref:`metricscarbon`

.. _setting-carbon-ourname:

``carbon-ourname``
------------------

-  String
-  Default: the hostname of the server

If sending carbon updates, if set, this will override our hostname. Be
careful not to include any dots in this setting, unless you know what
you are doing. See :ref:`metricscarbon`

.. _setting-carbon-server:

``carbon-server``
-----------------

-  IP Address

Send all available metrics to this server via the carbon protocol, which
is used by graphite and metronome. It has to be an address (no
hostnames). Moreover you can specify more than one server using a comma delimited list, ex:
carbon-server=10.10.10.10,10.10.10.20.
You may specify an alternate port by appending :port, ex:
127.0.0.1:2004. See :ref:`metricscarbon`.

.. _setting-chroot:

``chroot``
----------

-  Path

If set, chroot to this directory for more security. See :doc:`security`.
This is not recommended; instead, we recommend containing PowerDNS using operating system features.
We ship systemd unit files with our packages to make this easy.

Make sure that ``/dev/log`` is available from within the chroot. Logging
will silently fail over time otherwise (on logrotate).

When setting ``chroot``, all other paths in the config (except for
:ref:`setting-config-dir` and :ref:`setting-module-dir`)
set in the configuration are relative to the new root.

When running on a system where systemd manages services, ``chroot`` does
not work out of the box, as PowerDNS cannot use the ``NOTIFY_SOCKET``.
Either don't ``chroot`` on these systems or set the 'Type' of the
service to 'simple' instead of 'notify' (refer to the systemd
documentation on how to modify unit-files).

.. _setting-secondary-check-signature-freshness:

``secondary-check-signature-freshness``
---------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 4.7.0

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Enabled by default, freshness checks for secondary zones will set the DO flag on SOA queries. PowerDNS
can detect (signature) changes on the primary server without serial number bumps using the DNSSEC
signatures in the SOA response.

In some problematic scenarios, primary servers send truncated SOA responses. As a workaround, this setting
can be turned off, and the DO flag as well as the signature checking will be disabled. To avoid additional
drift, primary servers must then always increase the zone serial when it updates signatures.

It is strongly recommended to keep this setting enabled (`yes`).

.. _setting-config-dir:

``config-dir``
--------------

-  Path

Location of configuration directory (the directory containing ``pdns.conf``). Usually
``/etc/powerdns``, but this depends on ``SYSCONFDIR`` during
compile-time.

.. _setting-config-name:

``config-name``
---------------

-  String

Name of this virtual configuration - will rename the binary image. See
:doc:`guides/virtual-instances`.

.. _setting-consistent-backends:

``consistent-backends``
-----------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

.. versionadded:: 4.4.0

When this is set, PowerDNS assumes that any single zone lives in only one backend.
This allows PowerDNS to send ``ANY`` lookups to its backends, instead of sometimes requesting the exact needed type.
This reduces the load on backends by retrieving all the types for a given name at once, adding all of them to the cache.
It improves performance significantly for latency-sensitive backends, like SQL ones, where a round-trip takes serious time.

.. warning::
  This behaviour is only a meaningful optimization if the returned response to the ``ANY`` query can actually be cached,
  which is not the case if it contains at least one record with a non-zero scope. For this reason ``consistent-backends``
  should be disabled when at least one of the backends in use returns location-based records, like the GeoIP backend.

.. note::
  Pre 4.5.0 the default was no.

.. _setting-control-console:

``control-console``
-------------------

Debugging switch - don't use.

.. _setting-daemon:

``daemon``

.. note::
  Pre 4.2.0 the default was always no.

.. _setting-default-catalog-zone:

``default-catalog-zone``
------------------------

- String:
- Default: empty

.. versionadded:: 4.8.3

When a primary zone is created via the API, and the request does not specify a catalog zone, the name given here will be used.

.. _setting-default-ksk-algorithms:
.. _setting-default-ksk-algorithm:

``default-ksk-algorithm``
-------------------------

-  String
-  Default: ecdsa256

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-zone-metadata-cache-ttl`.

Seconds to cache zone metadata from the database. A value of 0
disables caching.

.. _setting-edns-cookie-secret:

``edns-cookie-secret``
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 4.6.0

-  String
-  Default: (empty)

When set, PowerDNS will respond with :rfc:`9018` EDNS Cookies to queries that have the EDNS0 Cookie option.
PowerDNS will also respond with BADCOOKIE to clients that have sent only a client cookie, or a bad server cookie (section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 of :rfc:`7873`).

This setting MUST be 32 hexadecimal characters, as the siphash algorithm's key used to create the cookie requires a 128-bit key.

.. _setting-edns-subnet-processing:

.. _setting-expand-alias:

``expand-alias``
----------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

If this is enabled, ALIAS records are expanded (synthesized to their
A/AAAA).

If this is disabled (the default), ALIAS records will not be expanded and
the server will return NODATA for A/AAAA queries for such names.

.. note::
  :ref:`setting-resolver` must also be set for ALIAS expansion to work!

.. note::
  In PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.0.x, this setting did not exist and
  ALIAS was always expanded.

.. _setting-forward-dnsupdate:

.conf are loaded in order using ``POSIX`` as locale.

.. _setting-launch:

``launch``
----------

-  Backend names, separated by commas

Which backends to launch and order to query them in. Launches backends.
In its most simple form, supply all backends that need to be launched.
e.g.

.. code-block:: ini

    launch=bind,gmysql,remote

If you find that you need to query a backend multiple times with
different configuration, you can specify a name for later
instantiations. e.g.:

.. code-block:: ini

    launch=gmysql,gmysql:server2

In this case, there are 2 instances of the gmysql backend, one by the
normal name and the second one is called 'server2'. The backend
configuration item names change: e.g. ``gmysql-host`` is available to
configure the ``host`` setting of the first or main instance, and
``gmysql-server2-host`` for the second one.

Running multiple instances of the BIND backend is not allowed.

.. _setting-load-modules:

``load-modules``
----------------

-  Paths, separated by commas

If backends are available in nonstandard directories, specify their
location here. Multiple files can be loaded if separated by commas. Only
available in non-static distributions.

.. _setting-local-address:

``local-address``
-----------------
.. versionchanged:: 4.3.0
  now also accepts IPv6 addresses

.. versionchanged:: 4.3.0
  Before 4.3.0, this setting only supported IPv4 addresses.

-  IPv4/IPv6 Addresses, with optional port numbers, separated by commas or whitespace
-  Default: ``0.0.0.0, ::``

Local IP addresses to which we bind. Each address specified can
include a port number; if no port is included then the
:ref:`setting-local-port` port will be used for that address. If a
port number is specified, it must be separated from the address with a
':'; for an IPv6 address the address must be enclosed in square
brackets.

Examples::

  local-address=127.0.0.1 ::1
  local-address=0.0.0.0:5353
  local-address=[::]:8053
  local-address=127.0.0.1:53, [::1]:5353

.. _setting-local-address-nonexist-fail:

``local-address-nonexist-fail``
-------------------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Fail to start if one or more of the
:ref:`setting-local-address`'s do not exist on this server.

.. _setting-local-ipv6:

``local-ipv6``
--------------
.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
   Use :ref:`setting-local-address` instead

.. _setting-local-ipv6-nonexist-fail:

``local-ipv6-nonexist-fail``
----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.3.0
  This setting has been removed, use :ref:`setting-local-address-nonexist-fail`

-  Default: no

If set to 'no', informative-only DNS details will not even be sent to
syslog, improving performance.

.. _setting-log-dns-queries:

``log-dns-queries``
-------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Tell PowerDNS to log all incoming DNS queries. This will lead to a lot
of logging! Only enable for debugging! Set :ref:`setting-loglevel`

``log-timestamp``
-----------------

- Bool
- Default: yes

Do not pass names like 'local0'!

.. _setting-loglevel:

``loglevel``
------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 4

Amount of logging. The higher the number, the more lines logged.
Corresponds to "syslog" level values (e.g. 0 = emergency, 1 = alert, 2 = critical, 3 = error, 4 = warning, 5 = notice, 6 = info, 7 = debug).
Each level includes itself plus the lower levels before it.
Not recommended to set this below 3.

.. _setting-loglevel-show:

``loglevel-show``
-------------------

-  Bool
-  Default: no

.. versionadded:: 4.9.0

``max-cache-entries``
---------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 1000000

Maximum number of entries in the query cache. 1 million (the default)
will generally suffice for most installations.

.. _setting-max-ent-entries:

``max-ent-entries``
-------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 100000

Maximum number of empty non-terminals to add to a zone. This is a
protection measure to avoid database explosion due to long names.

.. _setting-max-include-depth:

``max-include-depth``
----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 20

Maximum number of nested ``$INCLUDE`` directives while processing a zone file.
Zero mean no ``$INCLUDE`` directives will be accepted.

.. _setting-max-generate-steps:

``max-generate-steps``
----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0

Maximum number of steps for a '$GENERATE' directive when parsing a
zone file. This is a protection measure to prevent consuming a lot of
CPU and memory when untrusted zones are loaded. Default to 0 which
means unlimited.

.. _setting-max-nsec3-iterations:

``max-nsec3-iterations``
------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 100

Limit the number of NSEC3 hash iterations for zone configurations.
For more information see :ref:`dnssec-operational-nsec-modes-params`.

.. note::
  Pre 4.5.0 the default was 500.

.. _setting-max-packet-cache-entries:

``max-packet-cache-entries``
----------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 1000000

Maximum number of entries in the packet cache. 1 million (the default)
will generally suffice for most installations.

.. _setting-max-queue-length:

``max-queue-length``
--------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 5000

If this many packets are waiting for database attention, consider the
situation hopeless and respawn.

.. _setting-max-signature-cache-entries:

``max-signature-cache-entries``
-------------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 2^31-1 (on most systems), 2^63-1 (on ILP64 systems)

Maximum number of DNSSEC signature cache entries. This cache is
automatically reset once per week or when the cache is full. If you
use NSEC narrow mode, this cache can grow large.

.. _setting-max-tcp-connection-duration:

``max-tcp-connection-duration``
-------------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0

Maximum time in seconds that a TCP DNS connection is allowed to stay
open. 0 means unlimited. Note that exchanges related to an AXFR or IXFR
are not affected by this setting.

.. _setting-max-tcp-connections:

``max-tcp-connections``
-----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 20

Allow this many incoming TCP DNS connections simultaneously.

.. _setting-max-tcp-connections-per-client:

``max-tcp-connections-per-client``
----------------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0

Maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections per client. 0 means
unlimited.

.. _setting-max-tcp-transactions-per-conn:

``max-tcp-transactions-per-conn``
---------------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0

Allow this many DNS queries in a single TCP transaction. 0 means
unlimited. Note that exchanges related to an AXFR or IXFR are not
affected by this setting.

.. _setting-module-dir:

``module-dir``
--------------

-  Path

Directory for modules. Default depends on ``PKGLIBDIR`` during
compile-time.

.. _setting-negquery-cache-ttl:

``negquery-cache-ttl``
----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 60

Seconds to store queries with no answer in the Query Cache. See :ref:`query-cache`.

.. _setting-no-config:

``no-config``
-------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Do not attempt to read the configuration file. Useful for configuration
by parameters from the command line only.

.. _setting-no-shuffle:

``no-shuffle``
--------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Do not attempt to shuffle query results, used for regression testing.

.. _setting-non-local-bind:

``non-local-bind``
------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Bind to addresses even if one or more of the
:ref:`setting-local-address`'s do not exist on this server.
Setting this option will enable the needed socket options to allow
binding to non-local addresses. This feature is intended to facilitate
ip-failover setups, but it may also mask configuration issues and for
this reason it is disabled by default.

.. _setting-only-notify:

``only-notify``
---------------

-  IP Ranges, separated by commas or whitespace
-  Default: 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0

For type=MASTER zones (or SLAVE zones with slave-renotify enabled)
PowerDNS automatically sends NOTIFYs to the name servers specified in
the NS records. By specifying networks/mask as whitelist, the targets
can be limited. The default is to notify the world. To completely
disable these NOTIFYs set ``only-notify`` to an empty value. Independent
of this setting, the IP addresses or netmasks configured with
:ref:`setting-also-notify` and ``ALSO-NOTIFY`` zone metadata
always receive AXFR NOTIFYs.

IP addresses and netmasks can be excluded by prefixing them with a ``!``.
To notify all IP addresses apart from the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet use the following::

  only-notify=0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, !192.168.0.0/24

.. note::
  Even if NOTIFYs are limited by a netmask, PowerDNS first has to
  resolve all the hostnames to check their IP addresses against the
  specified whitelist. The resolving may take considerable time,
  especially if those hostnames are slow to resolve. If you do not need to
  NOTIFY the slaves defined in the NS records (e.g. you are using another
  method to distribute the zone data to the slaves), then set
  :ref:`setting-only-notify` to an empty value and specify the notification targets
  explicitly using :ref:`setting-also-notify` and/or
  :ref:`metadata-also-notify` zone metadata to avoid this potential bottleneck.

.. note::
  If your slaves support an Internet Protocol version, which your master does not,
  then set ``only-notify`` to include only supported protocol version.
  Otherwise there will be error trying to resolve address.

  For example, slaves support both IPv4 and IPv6, but PowerDNS master have only IPv4,
  so allow only IPv4 with ``only-notify``:

  .. code-block:: ini

    only-notify=0.0.0.0/0

.. _setting-outgoing-axfr-expand-alias:

``outgoing-axfr-expand-alias``
------------------------------

-  One of ``no``, ``yes``, or ``ignore-errors``, String
-  Default: no

.. versionchanged:: 4.9.0
  Option `ignore-errors` added.

If this is enabled, ALIAS records are expanded (synthesized to their
A/AAAA) during outgoing AXFR. This means slaves will not automatically
follow changes in those A/AAAA records unless you AXFR regularly!

If this is disabled (the default), ALIAS records are sent verbatim
during outgoing AXFR. Note that if your slaves do not support ALIAS,
they will return NODATA for A/AAAA queries for such names.

If the ALIAS target cannot be resolved during AXFR the AXFR will fail.
To allow outgoing AXFR also if the ALIAS targets are broken set this
setting to `ignore-errors`.
Be warned, this will lead to inconsistent zones between Primary and
Secondary name servers.

.. _setting-overload-queue-length:

``overload-queue-length``
-------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0 (disabled)

If this many packets are waiting for database attention, answer any new
questions strictly from the packet cache. Packets not in the cache will
be dropped, and :ref:`_stat-overload-drops` will be incremented.

.. _setting-prevent-self-notification:

``prevent-self-notification``
-----------------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

PowerDNS Authoritative Server attempts to not send out notifications to
itself in master mode. In very complicated situations we could guess
wrong and not notify a server that should be notified. In that case, set
prevent-self-notification to "no".

.. _setting-primary:

``primary``
-----------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-master` before 4.5.0.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Turn on operating as a primary. See :ref:`primary-operation`.

.. _setting-proxy-protocol-from:

``proxy-protocol-from``
-----------------------
.. versionadded:: 4.6.0

-  IP addresses or netmasks, separated by commas
-  Default: empty

Ranges that are required to send a Proxy Protocol version 2 header in front of UDP and TCP queries, to pass the original source and destination addresses and ports to the Authoritative.
Queries that are not prefixed with such a header will not be accepted from clients in these ranges. Queries prefixed by headers from clients that are not listed in these ranges will be dropped.

Note that once a Proxy Protocol header has been received, the source address from the proxy header instead of the address of the proxy will be checked against primary addresses sending NOTIFYs, and the ACLs for any client requesting AXFRs.
When using this setting combined with :ref:`setting-trusted-notification-proxy`, please be aware that the trusted address will also be checked against the source address in the PROXY header.

The dnsdist docs have `more information about the PROXY protocol <https://dnsdist.org/advanced/passing-source-address.html#proxy-protocol>`_.

.. _setting-proxy-protocol-maximum-size:

``proxy-protocol-maximum-size``
-------------------------------
.. versionadded:: 4.6.0

-  Integer
-  Default: 512

The maximum size, in bytes, of a Proxy Protocol payload (header, addresses and ports, and TLV values). Queries with a larger payload will be dropped.

.. _setting-query-cache-ttl:

``query-cache-ttl``
-------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 20

Seconds to store queries with an answer in the Query Cache. See :ref:`query-cache`.

.. _setting-query-local-address:

``query-local-address``
-----------------------
.. versionchanged:: 4.4.0
  Accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Also accept more than one address per
  address family.

-  IP addresses, separated by spaces or commas
-  Default: `0.0.0.0 ::`

The IP addresses to use as a source address for sending queries. Useful if
you have multiple IPs and PowerDNS is not bound to the IP address your
operating system uses by default for outgoing packets.

PowerDNS will pick the correct address family based on the remote's address (v4
for outgoing v4, v6 for outgoing v6). However, addresses are selected at random
without taking into account ip subnet reachability. It is highly recommended to
use the defaults in that case (the kernel will pick the right source address for
the network).

.. _setting-query-local-address6:

``query-local-address6``
------------------------
.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Removed. Use :ref:`setting-query-local-address`.

.. _setting-query-logging:

``query-logging``
-----------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Boolean, hints to a backend that it should log a textual representation
of queries it performs. Can be set at runtime.

.. _setting-queue-limit:

``queue-limit``
---------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 1500

Maximum number of milliseconds to queue a query. See :doc:`performance`.

.. _setting-receiver-threads:

``receiver-threads``
--------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 1

Number of receiver (listening) threads to start. See :doc:`performance`.

.. _setting-resolver:

``resolver``
------------

-  IP Address with optional port
-  Default: unset

Recursive DNS server to use for ALIAS lookups and the internal stub resolver. Only one address can be given.

Examples::

  resolver=127.0.0.1
  resolver=[::1]:5300

.. _setting-retrieval-threads:

``retrieval-threads``
---------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 2

Number of AXFR slave threads to start.

.. _setting-reuseport:

``reuseport``
-------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: No

On Linux 3.9 and some BSD kernels the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` option allows
each receiver-thread to open a new socket on the same port which allows
for much higher performance on multi-core boxes. Setting this option
will enable use of ``SO_REUSEPORT`` when available and seamlessly fall
back to a single socket when it is not available. A side-effect is that
you can start multiple servers on the same IP/port combination which may
or may not be a good idea. You could use this to enable transparent
restarts, but it may also mask configuration issues and for this reason
it is disabled by default.

.. _setting-rng:

``rng``
-------

- String
- Default: auto

Specify which random number generator to use. Permissible choices are:

- auto - choose automatically
- sodium - Use libsodium ``randombytes_uniform``
- openssl - Use libcrypto ``RAND_bytes``
- getrandom - Use libc getrandom, falls back to urandom if it does not really work
- arc4random - Use BSD ``arc4random_uniform``
- urandom - Use ``/dev/urandom``
- kiss - Use simple settable deterministic RNG. **FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!**

.. note::
  Not all choices are available on all systems.

.. _setting-secondary:

``secondary``
-------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-slave` before 4.5.0.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Turn on operating as a secondary. See :ref:`secondary-operation`.

.. _setting-secondary-do-renotify:

``secondary-do-renotify``
-------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-slave-renotify` before 4.5.0.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

This setting will make PowerDNS renotify the secondaries after an AXFR is
*received* from a primary. This is useful, among other situations, when running a
signing secondary.

See :ref:`metadata-slave-renotify` to set this per-zone.

.. _setting-security-poll-suffix:

``security-poll-suffix``
------------------------

-  String
-  Default: secpoll.powerdns.com.

Zone name from which to query security update notifications. Setting
this to an empty string disables secpoll.

.. _setting-send-signed-notify:

``send-signed-notify``
----------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

If yes, outgoing NOTIFYs will be signed if a TSIG key is configured for the zone.
If there are multiple TSIG keys configured for a zone, PowerDNS will use the
first one retrieved from the backend, which may not be the correct one for the
respective slave. Hence, in setups with multiple slaves with different TSIG keys
it may be required to send NOTIFYs unsigned.

.. _setting-server-id:

``server-id``
-------------

-  String
-  Default: The hostname of the server

This is the server ID that will be returned on an EDNS NSID query.

.. _setting-setgid:

``setgid``
----------

-  String

If set, change group id to this gid for more security. See :doc:`security`.

.. _setting-setuid:

``setuid``
----------

-  String

If set, change user id to this uid for more security. See :doc:`security`.

.. _setting-signing-threads:

``signing-threads``
-------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 3

Tell PowerDNS how many threads to use for signing. It might help improve
signing speed by changing this number.

.. _setting-slave:

``slave``
---------

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-secondary`.

.. _setting-slave-cycle-interval:

``slave-cycle-interval``
------------------------

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-xfr-cycle-interval`.

.. _setting-slave-renotify:

``slave-renotify``
------------------

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-secondary-do-renotify`.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

This setting will make PowerDNS renotify the slaves after an AXFR is
*received* from a master. This is useful when running a
signing-slave.

See :ref:`metadata-slave-renotify` to set this per-zone.

.. _setting-soa-expire-default:

``soa-expire-default``
----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 604800

.. deprecated:: 4.2.0
  This setting has been removed in 4.4.0

Default :ref:`types-soa` expire.

.. _setting-soa-minimum-ttl:

``soa-minimum-ttl``
-------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 3600

.. deprecated:: 4.2.0
  This setting has been removed in 4.4.0

Default :ref:`types-soa` minimum ttl.

.. _setting-soa-refresh-default:

``soa-refresh-default``
-----------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 10800

.. deprecated:: 4.2.0
  This setting has been removed in 4.4.0

Default :ref:`types-soa` refresh.

.. _setting-soa-retry-default:

``soa-retry-default``
---------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 3600

.. deprecated:: 4.2.0
  This setting has been removed in 4.4.0

Default :ref:`types-soa` retry.

.. _setting-socket-dir:

``socket-dir``
--------------

-  Path

Where the controlsocket will live. The default depends on
``LOCALSTATEDIR`` during compile-time (usually ``/var/run`` or
``/run``). See :ref:`control-socket`.

This path will also contain the pidfile for this instance of PowerDNS
called ``pdns.pid`` by default. See :ref:`setting-config-name`
and :doc:`Virtual Hosting <guides/virtual-instances>` how this can differ.

.. _setting-superslave:

``superslave``
---------------

.. deprecated:: 4.5.0
  Renamed to :ref:`setting-autosecondary`.

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Turn on supermaster support. See :ref:`supermaster-operation`.

.. _setting-svc-autohints:

``svc-autohints``
-----------------

- Boolean
- Default: no

.. versionadded:: 4.5.0

Whether or not to enable IPv4 and IPv6 :ref:`autohints <svc-autohints>`.

.. _setting-tcp-control-address:

``tcp-control-address``
-----------------------

-  IP Address

Address to bind to for TCP control.

.. _setting-tcp-control-port:

``tcp-control-port``
--------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 53000

Port to bind to for TCP control.

.. _setting-tcp-control-range:

``tcp-control-range``
---------------------

-  IP Ranges, separated by commas or whitespace

Limit TCP control to a specific client range.

.. _setting-tcp-control-secret:

``tcp-control-secret``
----------------------

-  String

Password for TCP control.

.. _setting-tcp-fast-open:

``tcp-fast-open``
-----------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 0 (Disabled)

Enable TCP Fast Open support, if available, on the listening sockets.
The numerical value supplied is used as the queue size, 0 meaning
disabled.

.. _setting-tcp-idle-timeout:

``tcp-idle-timeout``
--------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 5

Maximum time in seconds that a TCP DNS connection is allowed to stay
open while being idle, meaning without PowerDNS receiving or sending
even a single byte.

.. _setting-traceback-handler:

``traceback-handler``
---------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: yes

Enable the Linux-only traceback handler.

.. _setting-trusted-notification-proxy:

``trusted-notification-proxy``
------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.4.0
   This option now accepts a comma-separated list of IP ranges. This was a list of IP addresses before.

-  IP ranges, separated by commas

IP ranges of incoming notification proxies.

.. _setting-udp-truncation-threshold:

``udp-truncation-threshold``
----------------------------
-  Integer
-  Default: 1232

EDNS0 allows for large UDP response datagrams, which can potentially
raise performance. Large responses however also have downsides in terms
of reflection attacks. Maximum value is 65535, but values above
4096 should probably not be attempted.

.. note:: Why 1232?

  1232 is the largest number of payload bytes that can fit in the smallest IPv6 packet.
  IPv6 has a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes (:rfc:`RFC 8200, section 5 <8200#section-5>`), minus 40 bytes for the IPv6 header, minus 8 bytes for the UDP header gives 1232, the maximum payload size for the DNS response.

.. _setting-upgrade-unknown-types:

``upgrade-unknown-types``
-------------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

.. versionadded:: 4.4.0

Transparently upgrade records stored as `TYPE#xxx` and RFC 3597 (hex format)
contents, if the type is natively supported.
When this is disabled, records stored in this format cannot be served.

Recommendation: keep disabled for better performance.
Enable for testing PowerDNS upgrades, without changing stored records.
Enable for upgrading record content on secondaries, or when using the API (see :doc:`upgrade notes <../upgrading>`).
Disable after record contents have been upgraded.

This option is supported by the bind and Generic SQL backends.

.. note::
  When using a generic SQL backend, records with an unknown record type (see :doc:`../appendices/types`) can be identified with the following SQL query::

      SELECT * from records where type like 'TYPE%';

.. _setting-version-string:

``version-string``
------------------

-  Any of: ``anonymous``, ``powerdns``, ``full``, String
-  Default: full

When queried for its version over DNS
(``dig chaos txt version.bind @pdns.ip.address``), PowerDNS normally
responds truthfully. With this setting you can overrule what will be
returned. Set the ``version-string`` to ``full`` to get the default
behaviour, to ``powerdns`` to just make it state
``Served by PowerDNS - https://www.powerdns.com/``. The ``anonymous``
setting will return a ServFail, much like Microsoft nameservers do. You
can set this response to a custom value as well.

.. _setting-webserver:

``webserver``
-------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Start a webserver for monitoring. See :doc:`performance`".

.. _setting-webserver-address:

``webserver-address``
---------------------

-  IP Address
-  Default: 127.0.0.1

IP Address for webserver/API to listen on.

.. _setting-webserver-allow-from:

``webserver-allow-from``
------------------------

-  IP ranges, separated by commas or whitespace
-  Default: 127.0.0.1,::1

Webserver/API access is only allowed from these subnets.

.. _setting-webserver-hash-plaintext-credentials:

``webserver-hash-plaintext-credentials``
----------------------------------------
.. versionadded:: 4.6.0

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Whether passwords and API keys supplied in the configuration as plaintext should be hashed during startup, to prevent the plaintext versions from staying in memory. Doing so increases significantly the cost of verifying credentials and is thus disabled by default.
Note that this option only applies to credentials stored in the configuration as plaintext, but hashed credentials are supported without enabling this option.

.. _setting-webserver-loglevel:

``webserver-loglevel``
----------------------

-  String, one of "none", "normal", "detailed"
-  Default: normal

The amount of logging the webserver must do. "none" means no useful webserver information will be logged.
When set to "normal", the webserver will log a line per request that should be familiar::

  [webserver] e235780e-a5cf-415e-9326-9d33383e739e 127.0.0.1:55376 "GET /api/v1/servers/localhost/bla HTTP/1.1" 404 196

When set to "detailed", all information about the request and response are logged::

The value between the hooks is a UUID that is generated for each request. This can be used to find all lines related to a single request.

.. note::
  The webserver logs these line on the NOTICE level. The :ref:`setting-loglevel` seting must be 5 or higher for these lines to end up in the log.

.. _setting-webserver-max-bodysize:

``webserver-max-bodysize``
--------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 2

Maximum request/response body size in megabytes.

.. _setting-webserver-password:

``webserver-password``
----------------------
.. versionchanged:: 4.6.0
  This setting now accepts a hashed and salted version.

-  String

Password required to access the webserver. Since 4.6.0 the password can be hashed and salted using ``pdnsutil hash-password`` instead of being present in the configuration in plaintext, but the plaintext version is still supported.

.. _setting-webserver-port:

``webserver-port``
------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 8081

The port where webserver/API will listen on.

.. _setting-webserver-print-arguments:

``webserver-print-arguments``

.. _setting-workaround-11804:

``workaround-11804``
--------------------

-  Boolean
-  Default: no

Workaround for `issue #11804 (outgoing AXFR may try to overfill a chunk and fail) <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/11804>`_.

Default of no implies the pre-4.8 behaviour of up to 100 RRs per AXFR chunk.

If enabled, only a single RR will be put into each AXFR chunk, making some zones transferable when they were not.

.. _setting-xfr-cycle-interval:

``xfr-cycle-interval``
----------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-slave-cycle-interval` before 4.5.0.

-  Integer
-  Default: 60

On a primary, this is the amount of seconds between the primary checking
the SOA serials in its database to determine to send out NOTIFYs to the
secondaries. On secondaries, this is the number of seconds between the secondary
checking for updates to zones.

.. _setting-xfr-max-received-mbytes:

``xfr-max-received-mbytes``
---------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 100

Specifies the maximum number of received megabytes allowed on an
incoming AXFR/IXFR update, to prevent resource exhaustion. A value of 0
means no restriction.

.. _setting-zone-cache-refresh-interval:

``zone-cache-refresh-interval``
-------------------------------

-  Integer
-  Default: 300

Seconds to cache a list of all known zones. A value of 0 will disable the cache.

If your backends do not respond to unknown or dynamically generated zones, it is suggested to enable :ref:`setting-consistent-backends` (default since 4.5) and leave this option at its default of `300`.

.. _setting-zone-metadata-cache-ttl:

``zone-metadata-cache-ttl``
-----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.5.0
  This was called :ref:`setting-domain-metadata-cache-ttl` before 4.5.0.

-  Integer
-  Default: 60

Seconds to cache zone metadata from the database. A value of 0
disables caching.
