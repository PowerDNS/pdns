This document contains a technical description of PowerDNS.

<toc>
<sect>PowerDNS is a next generation authoritative nameserver
<p>
DNS is among the most mission-critical parts of the internet. While in
essence very simple, current implementations are complicated applications
with source code often spanning dozens of megabytes.

The growth of the number of domains means that there is a growing need for a
lean and mean nameserver that is capable of serving millions of users with
millions of domains.

The operation of PowerDNS consists of three different parts:
<itemize>
<item>Internet Interface
<item>Logical Engine
<item>Query Backend
</itemize>

The Internet Interface receives a question, and hands it to the Logical
Engine. This Logical Engine then splits up the question into the
sub-queries, which are handed to the Query Backend, which in turn sends
queries to any number of data sources. The answer is then transferred back by
the Logical Engine to the Internet Interface, which sends out the packet
containing the requested data.

<descrip>
<tag>The Internet Interface</tag>
PowerDNS supports receiving queries over UDP and TCP. When a question is
received, relevant parts of the packet containing the question are compared
to queries received earlier. 

<tag>The Logical Engine</tag>
A DNS query cannot be translated directly into a backend query. A question
might be 'What is the IP Address of www.site.com'. In order to answer this
question, some separate steps need to be performed:

<itemize>
<item>Is this nameserver Authoritative for this domain, or any of its parent
domains?
<item>Do we have a Canonical Name for www.site.com?
<item>Does www.site.com exist?
<item>Do we have an IP address for it?
<item>If we don't, do we know who does?
<item>Possibly send IP addresses for the nameservers who do know
</itemize>

This algorithm is described at length in RFC 1034.

<tag>The Query Backend</tag>
A real life nameserver may have many data sources. Several customer
databases might exist, as well as standard Zone files. The Query Backend
fields questions to any number of backends, in a prescribed order. This
allows for maximum flexibility.
</descrip>

<sect>Simplicity brings reliability 
<p> 

By building on top of existing databases, PowerDNS is as trustworthy as your
favorite database. Data storage and retrieval is a well solved problem. A
nameserver should not reinvent it. We support almost all industry standard
databases and also do custom backend development to graft PowerDNS on an
existing database or schema.

Due to the completely from scratch implementation without an existing
installed base to appease, PowerDNS has remained very lean and mean.

Monitoring is at the root of reliability, so the PowerDNS runtime can be
queried by external scripts. This enables the operator to be informed of any
problems at an early stage. Some sample scripts for the popular MRTG program
are supplied.

<sect>Incredible performance
<p>
Because of the many steps of the algorithm prescribed by RFC 1034, just
hooking on a database to a nameserver is not a recipe for great performance.
Steps need to be taken to streamline the process. 

PowerDNS does so in two ways: 
<descrip>
<tag>Reordering the steps of the algorithm</tag>
It is often possible to skip some of the steps in the algorithm initially,
and only perform the other steps when it is really needed, which is often
not the case.
<tag>The PacketCache</tag>
The PacketCache is quite revolutionary in that it caches entire query
packets for short amounts of time. This PacketCache is consulted before
running the RFC 1034 Algorithm in the Logical Engine. In production, it has
been confirmed that even a 1 minute cache can achieve a 80% hitrate and
thereby prevent 4 out of 5 database queries from ever happening.
</descrip>

Benchmarking has shown that PowerDNS should be able to reach in the order of
20.000 queries/second on a reasonably fast database. When using direct
tables like those supported by Berkeley DB, 50.000 should be achievable.

The use of POSIX Threads also allows PowerDNS to use a large number of
processors efficiently on architectures that support it.
<sect>Complete security
<p>
PowerDNS is written in highly portable C++ using the ISO Standard C++
Library (STL). This Library comes with dynamic string classes which all but
erase the possibility of the much feared buffer overflows that have been
hitting other nameservers.

The very modular design of PowerDNS also makes for strict internal
interfaces which can prevent any undesired action from having deleterious
effects.

Due to the use of modern tools and libraries, PowerDNS consists of only 7000
lines of source. This is very well auditable in a reasonable period of time
and can be regarded as a trusted computing base.

Because the database is most often external, it is highly useful to grant
PowerDNS read-only access to that database. Even a successful compromise can
than not easily be exploited, because the database refuses to accept updates
from the nameserver.

<sect>Special Functions
<p>
Besides doing lookups in well known databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL
Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Sybase, there are special purpose backends
available.

<sect1>Very Large Zone support
<p>
For customers with very large zones and a lots of secondaries, a special
module has been developed to meet the following goals:
<itemize>
<item>Absolute 100% robustness
<item>Incremental updates
<item>Near realtime updates
<item>Idempotent update packets
<item>Instantaneous zone reloading
</itemize>

In short, this means that updates are broadcast from a central point. These
updates can be broadcast as many times as desired because there is no harm
in applying them more than once. Each of these updates is applied within
seconds. 

It does not use a relational database but instead relies on any of the
well known table engines that are available, with a strong slant towards
Berkeley DB.
<sect1>Global Redirection
<p>
With the aid of a comprehensive map of IP addresses, it is possible to do
smart routing of customers to servers geographically near them. While not
providing pin-point accuracy, it is broadly effective and very fast.

<sect1>DNS based loadbalancing and failover
<p>
Because of the efficiency of PowerDNS, it is feasible to use very low TTLs
on answers. This in turn makes it possible to perform DNS based
loadbalancing and failover. This can be very robust because the DNS
infrastructure itself is redundant, whereas regular loadbalancing agents are
themselves a single point of failure.

<sect1>CORBA backend
<p>
By allowing questions to be asked over this industry standard protocol,
it becomes trivially easy to integrate PowerDNS with existing middleware
applications and/or customer databases.

<sect>Standards compliance
<p>
PowerDNS is committed to being fully standards compliant. Current supported
standards include RFC 1034, RFC 1035 and RFC 2181. 

<sect>Availability
<p>
PowerDNS is available immediately for use. It comes with completely
documented source and a license that allows the end-user to improve and or
change the source.

Licensing is possible on a per-CPU or on a per-Domain basis. 

PowerDNS is a fully supported product with different levels of support
available.
