This document describes what PowerDNS is, how it works and how it can be
maintained and operated.
</abstract>
<toc>
<sect>The PowerDNS modular system
<p>
PowerDNS consists of four distinct modules:
<itemize>
<item>Internet Nameserver
<item>Logical Engine
<item>Query Backend
<item>Web-enabled configuration
</itemize>

Each of these modules can function on its own, and is therefore eminently
testable and provably correct.

When a DNS query comes in ('What is the IP Address of come.to'), it is
received by the Internet Nameserver, which parses the packet and sends it to
the Logical Engine. The Logical Engine then tries to find the best answer
possible to the question.

To do so, it applies certain rules. Is 'come.to' a globally redirected host?
If it isn't, is it perhaps an alias for another host? Or do we simply need
to look up the IP address, and return that. Each of these questions is
fielded to the Query Backend.

This query backend often just translates the question into SQL, and passes
it to a relational database, like Oracle, MS SQLServer or PostgreSQL.

A web-frontend is provided for configuring PowerDNS. This frontend is
multi-user aware, so responsibilities can be delegated, whereby each
operator can only manage his or her domains.

More on the frontend the relevant chapter.

<sect>PowerDNS Operation &amp; Operational Limits
<p>
PowerDNS has been designed to be easy to operate and to function robustly.
For example, should an unexpected exception occur, the program is restarted
automatically, within seconds.

<sect1>Installation
<p>
PowerDNS can span multiple computers, which either all connect to the same
database, or each have their own mirrored copy. Normally, PowerDNS is sold
using an ASP model. However, our initial customer may choose to have a
local, privately owned installation.

We will assist or even perform the installation for such a customer.

Engineered for simplicity, configuring the nameserver itself (not the
domains, these are configured using the web-frontend) is done from one
single point, with only a limited number of settings that need to be
changed.

<sect1>Operational Limits
<p>
Extensive benchmarking has convinced us that network capacity is more of a
limiting factor than PowerDNS itself will ever be. In testing, the PowerDNS
server sustained 1500 queries/s on a regular desktop PC for a prolonged
period of time. It is assumed that this is more than even the biggest
current nameservers need to handle.

<sect1>Maintaining and configuring domains
<p>
Great care has been taken to make the maintenance and configuration of
domains as easy as possible. Two modes are available, 'Wizard' 
and 'Advanced'. This latest mode is 'vocabulary compatible' with the Bind
nameserver, so existing administrators will feel right at home. The Wizard
mode has been stripped of all jargon, and should be easy to follow for most
Internet users.

The Wizard mode also performs stringent tests on the information entered by
the operator, so as to prevent misconfiguration.

<sect>Features
<p>
PowerDNS has the following features:
<descrip>
<tag>Regular nameserving</tag>
A better performing and robust nameserver. Feature set is limited to current
and near-future internet practices. Other nameservers often support arcane
and outdated Name Classes, like those used at MIT in the 1980s. Supporting
these classes involves shipping more code, which might contain more security
problems and bugs. More on security in the relevant chapter.
<tag>Failover</tag>
When multiple webservers are available, PowerDNS can be configured to only
return IP Addresses of the servers which are actually functioning. This
feature has been available for a long time from companies like Alteon or
Arrowpoint (now both Cisco property).

However, these machines can only function on local networks, as they
function as a network-element. All your servers need to be in the same
location for this to work. This is clearly not appropriate in case of
maximum availability. 
<tag>Global Redirection</tag>
In combination with Failover support, it is possible to support smart global
redirection, whereby American customers might get connected to a server in
New York, whereas European customers might be served by a computer in
Amsterdam.

<tag>Mail forwarding</tag>
Although not strictly a Nameserver function, PowerDNS supports very rapid
and robust mail forwarding. This system has already been employed the past
months to forward mail for the V3 domains. It is specially engineered to not
fall over in case of database problems, should they occur, for example when
the database is suffering from a Denial of Service, as recently happened.

<tag>URL Aliasing</tag>
Much of the same goes for this. Customers can use URL Aliasing to let them
point their (sub)domain to other webpages.

<tag>Mail hosting</tag>
The entire concept of mail hosting was re-engineered because it was found
that existing systems suffered from sub-optimal performance, with a large
server able to handle only 50.000 mailboxes at a time.

This support consists of SMTP, Pop and IMAP4, which makes it compatible with
almost all webmail solutions available.

</descrip>

<sect>Security and Reliability
<p>
<sect1>Security
<p>
Nameserving is a complex business. Currently, it is evident that existing
servers suffer from security and Denial of Service vulnerabilities. 

There are several reasons for these problems:
<descrip>
<tag>Support for obsolete protocols</tag>
Nameservers currently in use support ancient pre-Internet protocols like
Hesiod and Chaosnet. Even if you are an Internet-only user, like everybody
these days, your nameserver will still respond to packets containing
questions for these protocols. The code supporting these features stems from
the early 1980s and hasn't been audited in ages.

The support for these protocols also causes other nameservers to be bigger
than they need be.

<tag>Support for undesirable features</tag>
This is the cause of the most recent bout of Bind problems. Bind 
supports 'inverse queries', also known as 'iqueries'. This is a Jeopardy like
situation whereby you ask a nameserver 'Which question has this answer'.
These questions are no longer appropriate in a time where the Internet can
at best be considered a unfriendly place.

<tag>Complete integration</tag> 
Current nameservers are completely integrated solutions, carrying within
their codebase a complete database and replication facility - which is
exposed to the world.  By offloading this functionality to a separate
Relational Database, complexity is vastly reduced. Furthermore, relational
databases are very trusted systems - it is good to leave the hard work to
them.

<tag>Use of outdated languages</tag>
With languages like C it is very easy to make programming mistakes which
endanger system security. By using C++ with full typechecking and dynamic
strings, a lot of problems are avoided. It is no longer possible 
to 'overflow the buffer', as it is called.
</descrip>

<sect1>Reliability 
<p> 
PowerDNS can be operated from two or more completely independent locations.
Failure of the one does not hamper the other. Each of these locations can
easily be redundant in itself. UDP, the protocol over which DNS questions
are asked and answered on the internet, lends itself very well to clustering
solutions. It is advised that each location consists of two unconnected
computers in a failover setup. The 'Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol'
suffices, one of the easiest ways to set up a redundant group of computers.

Regular nameservers can only run off their secondary for a limited period of
time (often measured in days!). PowerDNS does not have this limitation.

<sect>Statistics, Logging &amp; Monitoring 
<p>
PowerDNS can be configured to keep extensive details on its operation. From
these details, which are available in an easily parseable ASCII form, it is
possible to compile statistics.

Of possible interest are:
<itemize>
<item>Number of questions for which PowerDNS had no answer
<item>Average time needed to find answer to a question
<item>Number of questions per second handled
</itemize>

Should there be a need, graphs can be compiled in realtime using the popular
MRTG utility, which is easily interfaced onto PowerDNS.

<sect>PowerDNS as a Registrar or domain-merchant Backend
<p>
The Web-frontend that comes with PowerDNS is engineered to support millions
of users simultaneously. When stripped of advanced features, it makes a fine
platform for any Registrar or domain-merchant.

Everything in PowerDNS has been designed for incredibly high performance, so
it is possible to support huge numbers of users on limited amounts of
hardware.

There is no point in the system which needs to be implemented as a single
computer - all parts can be grown to span multiple servers.

<sect>Competition
<p>
Besides the widely used Bind nameserver, there are other solutions
available. Each of these solutions has its pros and cons.
<sect1>F5 3DNS
<p>

Based on an expanded version of BIND, it offers a lot of interesting
features, like global redirection and loadbalancing. It needs 
several 'probes' at your datacenters, which attempt to measure network 
connectivity.

Unclear how it scales to larger number of domains, or even subdomains. Might
conflict with plans of being a 'subdomain registrar'.

Can combine with the 'Big-IP Controller' for local failover and
loadbalancing. 
<sect1>Cisco Distributed Director
<p>
Is a weird contraption, which has been reported to take up to an hour to
process any configuration changes. Uses complicated BGP metrics to calculate
the optimum server for a user. In our experience, BGP is no longer the right
way to do so. BGP differentiates the internet into so called Autonomous
Subsystems. These days however, most of the AS's out there spread the globe.

The Cisco Distributed Director will not be able to differentiate via BGP
between a server or user located in San Francisco or one in Moscow, if both
are in the MCI Worldcom network.

This machine also appears to require machines at each server location.

Also unclear how it handles large numbers of domains, especially given the
time it needs to process configuration changes.
