# End of life statements
The currently supported release trains of PowerDNS are 4.x (preferred) and 3.x (legacy).  
2.x is end of life.

## PowerDNS Authoritative Server 2.x
21st of May 2015

PowerDNS Authoritative Server 2.9.22 was released more than 6 years ago, in
January 2009.  Because of its immense and durable popularity, some patch
releases have been provided, the last one of which (2.9.22.6) was made
available over three years ago in January 2012.

The 2.9.22.x series contains a number of probable and actual violations of
the DNS standards.  In addition, some behaviours of 2.9.22.x are standards
conforming but cause interoperability problems in 2015.  Finally, 2.9.22.4
and earlier are impacted by [PowerDNS Security Advisory 2012-01](https://doc.powerdns.com/md/security/powerdns-advisory-2012-01/), which means
PowerDNS can be used in a Denial of Service attack.

Although we have long been telling users that we can no longer support the
use of 2.x, and urging upgrades to 3.x, with this statement we formally
declare 2.x end of life.

This means that any 2.x issues will not be addressed. This has been the case
for a long time, but with this statement we make it formal.

To upgrade to 3.x, please consult the [instructions on how to upgrade the
database](https://doc.powerdns.com/md/authoritative/upgrading/#29x-to-30).  If you need help with upgrading, we provide [migration services](https://www.powerdns.com/support-services-consulting.html) to
our supported users.  If you are currently running 2.9.22 and need help to
tide you over, we can also provide that as part of a [support agreement](https://www.powerdns.com/support-services-consulting.html).

But we urge everyone to move on to PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4 or
later - it is a faster, more standards conforming and more powerful
nameserver!
