API Spec
========

This API runs over HTTP, preferably HTTPS.

Design Goals
------------

* Discovery endpoint
* Unified API Scheme for Daemons & Console.
  Think of the Console Server as a proxy for all your pdns deployments.
* Have API docs (this!) for other consumers

Data format
-----------

Input data format: JSON.

Output data formats: JSON, JSONP

All GET requests support appending a `_callback` URL parameter, which, if
present, will turn the response into a JSONP response.

The `Accept:` header determines the output format. An unknown value or
`*/*` will cause a `400 Bad Request`.

All text is UTF-8 and HTTP headers will reflect this.

Data types:

  * empty fields: `null` but present
  * Regex: implementation defined
  * Dates: ISO 8601


REST
----

* GET: List/Retrieve. Success reply: `200 OK`
* POST: Create. Success reply: `201 Created`, with new object as body.
* PUT: Update. Success reply: `200 OK`, with modified object as body.
* DELETE: Delete. Success reply: `200 OK`, no body.

not-so-REST
-----------

For interactions that do not directly map onto CRUD, we use these:

* GET: Query. Success reply: `200 OK`
* PUT: Action/Execute. Success reply: `200 OK`

Action/Execute methods return a JSON body of this format:

    {
      "message": "result message"
    }


Authentication
--------------

The PowerDNS daemons accept a static API Key, which has to be sent in the
`X-API-Key` header.

Note: Authoritative Server 3.4.0 and Recursor 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 use HTTP
Basic Authentication instead.


Errors
------

Response code `4xx` or `5xx`, depending on the situation. Never return `2xx`
for an error!

* Invalid JSON body from client: `400 Bad Request`
* JSON body from client not a hash: `400 Bad Request`
* Input validation failed: `422 Unprocessable Entity`

Error responses have a JSON body of this format:

    {
      "error": "short error message",
      "errors": [
        { ... },
      ]
    }

Where `errors` is optional, and the contents are error-specific.


Common Error Causes
-------------------

##### 400 Bad Request

1. The client body was not a JSON document, or it could not be parsed, or the root element of the JSON document was not a hash.
2. The client did not send an `Accept:` header, or it was set to `*/*`.
3. For requests that operate on a zone, the `zone_id` URL part was invalid. To get a valid `zone_id`, list the zones with the `/servers/:server_id/zones` endpoint.


URL: /
------

Allowed methods: `GET`

    {
      "server_url": "/servers{/server}",
      "api_features": [],
    }

**TODO**:

* Not yet implemented.
* `api_features`
  * `servers_modifiable`
  * `oauth`


General Collections Interface
=============================

Collections generally support `GET` and `POST` with these meanings:

GET
---

Retrieve a list of all entries.

The special `type` and `url` fields are included in the response objects:

  * `type`: name of the resource type
  * `url`: url to the object


Response format:

    [
      obj1
      [, further objs]
    ]

Example:

    [
      {
        "type": "AType",
        "id": "anid",
        "url": "/atype/anid",
        "a_field": "a_value"
      },
      {
        "type": "AType",
        "id": "anotherid",
        "url": "/atype/anotherid",
        "a_field": "another_value"
      }
    ]


POST
----

Create a new entry. The client has to supply the entry in the request body,
in JSON format. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data MUST NOT be sent.

Clients SHOULD not send the 'url' field.

Client body:

    obj1

Example:

    {
      "type": "AType",
      "id": "anewid",
      "a_field": "anew_value"
    }




Servers
=======

**TODO**: further routes


server_resource
---------------

Example with server `"localhost"`, which is the only server returned by pdns.

pdnsmgrd and pdnscontrol MUST NOT return “localhost”, but SHOULD return
other servers.

    {
      "type": "Server",
      "id": "localhost",
      "url": "/servers/localhost",
      "daemon_type": "recursor",
      "version": "VERSION",
      "config_url": "/servers/localhost/config{/config_setting}",
      "zones_url": "/servers/localhost/zones{/zone}",
    }

Note: On a pdns server, the servers collection is read-only, and the only
allowed returned server is read-only as well.
On a pdnscontrol server, the servers collection is read-write, and the
returned server resources are read-write as well. Write permissions may
depend on the credentials you have supplied.

* daemon_type
  May be one of `authoritative`, `recursor`.


URL: /servers
-------------

Collection access.

Allowed REST methods:

* pdns: `GET`
* pdnsmgrd: `GET`
* pdnscontrol: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`


URL: /servers/:server\_id
-------------------------

Returns a single server_resource.



Config
======


config\_setting\_resource
-------------------------

    {
       "type": "ConfigSetting",
       "name": "config_setting_name",
       "value": "config_setting_value"
    }


URL: /servers/:server\_id/config
--------------------------------

Collection access.

Allowed REST methods: `GET`, `POST`

#### POST

Creates a new config setting. This is useful for creating configuration for new backends.

**TODO**: Not yet implemented.


URL: /servers/:server\_id/config/:config\_setting\_name
-------------------------------------------------------

Allowed REST methods: `GET`, `PUT`

**NOTE**: only the Recursors `allow_from` configuration setting can be retrieved or modified.


Zones
=====

Authoritative DNS Zones.

A Resource Record Set (below as "RRset") are all records for a given name and type.

Comments are per-RRset.


zone_collection
---------------

    {
      "id": "<id>",
      "name": "<string>",
      "type": "Zone",
      "url": "/servers/:server_id/zones/:id",
      "kind": "<kind>",
      "serial": <int>,
      "notified_serial": <int>,
      "masters": ["<ip>", ...],
      "dnssec": <bool>,
      "nsec3param": "<nsec3param record>",
      "nsec3narrow": <bool>,
      "presigned": <bool>,
      "soa_edit": "<string>",
      "soa_edit_api": "<string>",
      "nameservers": ["<string>", ...],
      "servers": ["<string>", ...],
      "recursion_desired": <bool>,
      "records": [<record>, ...],
      "comments": [<comment>, ...],
    }


##### Parameters:

* `id`
  Opaque zone id (string), assigned by the Server. Do not interpret.
  Guaranteed to be safe for embedding in URLs.

* `kind`
  Authoritative: `<kind>`: `Native`, `Master` or `Slave`
  Recursor: `<kind>`: `Native`, or `Forwarded`

* `dnssec`
  inferred from `presigned` being `true` XOR presence of at
  least one cryptokey with `active` being `true`.

  Switching `dnssec` to `true` (from `false`) sets up DNSSEC signing
  based on the other flags, this includes running the equivalent of
  `secure-zone` and `rectify-zone`. This also applies to newly created
  zones.
  If `presigned` is `true`, no DNSSEC changes will be made to the zone
  or cryptokeys.
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

  **TODO**: `dnssec`, `nsec3narrow`, `nsec3param`, `presigned` are not yet implemented.

* `soa_edit` MAY be set to change the `SOA-EDIT` zone setting. See
  http://doc.powerdns.com/html/domainmetadata.html for more information.
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

* `soa_edit_api` MAY be set. If it is set, on changes to the contents of
  a zone made through the API, the SOA record will be edited according to
  the SOA-EDIT-API rules. (Which are the same as the SOA-EDIT rules.)
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

* `notified_serial`, `serial` MUST NOT be sent in client bodies.
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

* `nameservers` MAY be sent in client bodies during creation, and MUST
  NOT be sent by the server. Simple list of strings of nameserver names.
  **Note**: Authoritative only. Not required for slave zones.

* `servers`: list of forwarded-to servers, including port.
  **Note**: Recursor only.

* `recursion_desired`: for `Forwarded` zones, if the RD bit should
  be set.
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

* `records`: list of DNS records in the zone.
  **Note**: Modifications are supported on Authoritative only.

* `comments`: list of comments in the zone.
  **Note**: Authoritative only.

##### Notes:

Turning on DNSSEC with custom keys: just create the zone with `dnssec`
set to `false`, and add keys using the cryptokeys REST interface. Have
at least one of them `active` set to `true`. **TODO**: not yet
implemented.

Changes made through the Zones API will always yield valid zone data,
and the zone will be properly "rectified" (**TODO**: not yet
implemented). If changes are made through other means (e.g. direct
database access), this is not guranteed to be true and clients SHOULD
trigger rectify.

Backends might implement additional features (by coincidence or not).
These things are not supported through the API.

When creating a slave zone, it is recommended to not set any of
`nameservers`, `records`.


URL: /servers/:server\_id/zones
-------------------------------

Allowed REST methods: `GET`, `POST`

#### POST
Creates a new domain.

* `dnssec`, `nsec3narrow`, `presigned`, `nsec3param`, `active-keys` are OPTIONAL.
* `dnssec`, `nsec3narrow`, `presigned` default to `false`.
* The server MUST create a SOA record. The created SOA record SHOULD have
serial set to the value given as `serial` (or 0 if missing), use the
nameserver name, email, TTL values as specified in the pdns configuration
(`default-soa-name`, `default-soa-mail`, etc).
These default values can be overridden by supplying a custom SOA record in
the records list.
If `soa_edit_api` is set, the SOA record is edited according to the SOA-EDIT-API
rules before storing it. (Also applies to custom SOA records.)

**TODO**: `dnssec`, `nsec3narrow`, `nsec3param`, `presigned` are not yet implemented.

URL: /servers/:server\_id/zones/:zone\_id
-----------------------------------------

Allowed methods: `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

#### GET
Returns zone information.

#### DELETE
Deletes this zone, all attached metadata and rrsets.

#### PATCH

Modifies present RRsets and comments.

**Note**: Authoritative only.

Client body for PATCH:

    { "rrsets":
      [
        {
          "name": <string>,
          "type": <string>,
          "changetype": <changetype>,
          "records":
            [
              {
                "content": <string>,
                "name": <string>,
                "ttl": <int>,
                "type": <string>,
                "disabled": <bool>,
                "set-ptr": <bool>
              }, ...
            ],
          "comments":
            [
              {
                "account": <string>,
                "content": <string>,
                "modfied_at": <int>
              }, ...
            ]
        },
        { ... }
      ]
    }

Having `type` inside an RR differ from `type` at the top level is an error.

* `name`
  Full name of the RRset to modify. (Example: `foo.example.org`)

* `type`
  Type of the RRset to modify. (Example: `AAAA`)

* `changetype`
  Must be `REPLACE` or `DELETE`.
  With `DELETE`, all existing RRs matching `name` and `type` will be deleted, incl. all comments.
  With `REPLACE`: when `records` is present, all existing RRs matching `name` and `type` will be deleted, and then new records given in `records` will be created.
  If no records are left, any existing comments will be deleted as well.
  When `comments` is present, all existing comments for the RRs matching `name` and `type` will be deleted, and then new comments given in `comments` will be created.

* `records`
  List of new records (replacing the old ones). Must be empty when `changetype` is set to `DELETE`.
  An empty list results in deletion of all records (and comments).
  A record consists of these fields:
  * `type`: DNS type (MUST match outer `type`)
  * `name`: full name (MUST match outer `name`)
  * `ttl`: DNS TTL in seconds
  * `content`: the record content. Must confirm to the DNS content rules for the specified `type`. (PowerDNS hint: includes the backend's `priority` field.)
  * `disabled`: if this record will be hidden from DNS. (true: hidden, false: visible (the default)).
  * `set-ptr`: If set to true, the server will find the matching reverse zone and create a `PTR` there. Existing `PTR` records are replaced. If no matching reverse Zone, an error is thrown. Only valid in client bodies, only valid for `A` and `AAAA` types. Not returned by the server. Only valid for the Authoritative server.

* `comments`
  List of new comments (replacing the old ones). Must be empty when `changetype` is set to `DELETE`.
  An empty list results in deletion of all comments.
  `modified_at` is optional and defaults to the current server time.
  `account` is a field with user-defined meaning.

#### PUT

Modifies basic zone data (metadata).

Allowed fields in client body: all except `id` and `url`.

Changing `name` renames the zone, as expected.

Fails when zone kind is not `Master` or `Slave`, or `master` and `slave` are 
disabled in pdns configuration. Only works for `Slave` if renotify is on.

Not supported for recursors.

Clients MUST NOT send a body.


URL: /servers/:server\_id/zones/:zone\_id/axfr-retrieve
-------------------------------------------------------

Allowed methods: `PUT`

Retrieves the zone from the master.

Fails when zone kind is not `Slave`, or `slave` is disabled in pdns
configuration.
