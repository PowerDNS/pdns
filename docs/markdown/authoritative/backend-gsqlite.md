**Warning**: When importing large amounts of data, be sure to run 'analyze;' afterwards as SQLite3 has a tendency to use sub-optimal indexes otherwise.

This backend retrieves all data from a SQLite database, which is an RDBMS that's embedded into the application itself, so you won't need to be running a separate server process. It also reduces overhead, and simplifies installation. At [www.sqlite.org](http://www.sqlite.org) you can find more information about SQLite.

As this is a generic backend, built on top of the gSql framework, you can specify all queries as documented in [Generic MySQL and PgSQL backends](backend-generic-mypgsql.md#queries-and-settings).

SQLite exists in two incompatible versions, numbered 2 and 3, and from 2.9.21 onwards, PowerDNS supports both. It is recommended to go with version 3 as it is newer, has better performance and is actively maintained. To use version 3, choose `launch=gsqlite3`.

## Compiling the SQLite backend
Before you can begin compiling PowerDNS with the SQLite backend you need to have the SQLite utility and library installed on your system. You can download these from <http://www.sqlite.org/download.html>, or you can use packages (if your distribution provides those).

When you've installed the library you can use: `./configure --with-modules="gsqlite"` or `./configure --with-modules="gsqlite3"` to configure PowerDNS to use the SQLite backend. Compilation can then proceed as usual.

SQLite is included in most PowerDNS binary releases.

## Setting up the database
Before you can use this backend you first have to set it up and fill it with data. The default setup conforms to the following schema:

```
!!include=../modules/gsqlite3backend/schema.sqlite3.sql
```

This schema contains all elements needed for master, slave and superslave operation.

After you have created the database you probably want to fill it with data. If you have a BIND zone file it's as easy as: `zone2sql --zone=myzonefile --gsqlite | sqlite powerdns.sqlite`, but you can also use AXFR (or insert data manually).

To communicate with a SQLite database, use either the 'sqlite' or 'sqlite3' program, and feed it SQL.

## Configuration Parameters
These are the configuration file parameters that are available for the gsqlite3 backend.

### `(gsqlite3)-database`
Filename of the SQLite3 database.

### `(gsqlite3)-pragma-synchronous`
Set this to 0 for blazing speed.

### `(gsqlite3)-pragma-foreign-keys`
Enable foreign key constraints.

### `(gsqlite3)-dnssec`
Enable DNSSEC processing.

## Using the SQLite backend
The last thing you need to do is telling PowerDNS to use the SQLite backend.

```
# in pdns.conf
launch=gsqlite # or gsqlite3
gsqlite-database=<path to your SQLite database>   # or gsqlite3-database
```

Then you can start PowerDNS and it should notify you that a connection to the database was made.
