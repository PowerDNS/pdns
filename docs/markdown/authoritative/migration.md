#Â Migrating to PowerDNS
Before migrating to PowerDNS a few things should be considered.

PowerDNS does not operate as a ['slave'](modes-of-operation.md#slave-operation)
or ['master'](modes-of-operation.md#master-operation) server with all backends.
The [Generic SQL](backend-generic-sql.md), [BIND](backend-bind.md) backends have
the ability to act as master or slave. See the [table of backends](index.md#backend-capabilities)
which other backends support these modes.

# Using AXFR to a Slave-Capable Backend
The easiest way to migrate all your zones from your old infrastructure to PowerDNS
is to add all your domains as a slave domain with your current master as the
master, wait for the zones to be transferred and change the zones to master.
Make sure [`slave`](settings.md#slave) is set to "yes" in your pdns.conf.

## To A Generic SQL Backend
**Note**: This assumes the schema provided with PowerDNS is in place

In order to migrate to a Generic SQL backend, add all your domains to the 'domains'
table with the IP of your current master. On your current master, make sure that
this master allows AXFRs to this new slave.

```
INSERT INTO domains (name,type,master) VALUES ('example.net', 'SLAVE', '198.51.100.101');
```

Then start PowerDNS and wait for all the zones to be transferred. If this server
is the new [master](modes-of-operation.md#master-operation), change the type of
domain in the database:

```
UPDATE domains set type='MASTER' where type='SLAVE';
```

And set [`master`](settings.md#master) to "yes" in your pdns.conf and restart
PowerDNS.

Or, if you want to use [native](modes-of-operation.md#native-operation):

```
UPDATE domains set type='NATIVE' where type='SLAVE';
```

## To the BIND backend
Create a named.conf with all the domains as slave domains, e.g.:

```
zone "example.net" in {
  type slave;
  file "/var/lib/powerdns/zones/example.net.zone";
  masters {
    198.51.100.101;
  };
};
```

Make sure the directory is writable for the `pdns_server` process and that [`bind-config`](backend-bind.md#bind-config)
parameter references this file. Now start PowerDNS and wait untill all zones are
transferred. Now you can change the zone type to master:

```
zone "example.net" in {
  type master;
  file "/var/lib/powerdns/zones/example.net.zone";
};
```

Don't forget to enable [`master`](settings.md#master) in your pdns.conf and restart,
or if this setting was already set, use `pdns_control rediscover` to load these
zones as master zones.

# From zonefiles to PowerDNS
## Using the BIND backend
To use the bind backend, set `launch=bind` and `bind-config=/path/to/named.conf`
in your `pdns.conf`. Note that PowerDNS will not honor any options from named.conf,
it will only use the `zone` statements. See the [Bind backend](backend-bind.md)
documentation for more information.

## To a Generic SQL backend
There are several methods to migrate to a [Generic SQL](backend-generic-sql.md)
backend.

### Using `zone2sql`
To migrate, the `zone2sql` tool is provided. This tool parses a BIND `named.conf`
file and zone files and outputs SQL on standard out, which can then be fed to your
database. It understands the Bind master file extension `$GENERATE` and will also
honour `$ORIGIN` and `$TTL`.

For backends supporting slave operation, there is also an option to keep slave
zones as slaves, and not convert them to native operation.

`zone2sql` can generate SQL for nearly all the Generic SQL backends. See [its
manpage](../manpages/zone2sql.1.md) for more information.

An example call to `zone2sql` could be:

```
zone2sql --named-conf=/path/to/named.conf --gmysql | mysql -u pdns -p pdns-db
```

This will generate the SQL statements for the [Generic MySQL](backend-generic-mysql.md)
and pipe them into the pdns-db database in MySQL.

### Using `pdnsutil load-zone`
The [`pdnsutil`](../manpages/pdnsutil.1.md) tool has a `load-zone` command that ingests a zone file and imports it into the first backend that is capable of hosting it.

To import, configure the backend and run `pdnsutil load-zone example.com /tmp/example.com.com.zone` to import the `example.com` domain from the `/tmp/example.com.zone` file.
The zone is imported atomically (i.e. it is fully imported, or not) and any existing records for that zone are overwritten.

# Migrating Data from one Backend to Another Backend
NB! This is experimental feature.

Syntax: `pdnsutil b2b-migrate old new`

This tool lets you migrate data from one backend to another, it moves all data,
including zones, metadata and crypto keys (if present). Some example use cases
are moving from Bind style zonefiles to SQL based, or other way around, or moving
from MyDNS to gMySQL.

## Prerequisites

 - Target backend must support same features as source from set of domains, zones, metadata, DNSSEC and TSIG. See [Backend Capabilities](index.md)
 - There must be no data in the target backend, otherwise the migration will fail. This is checked.

You can perform live upgrade with this tool, provided you follow the procedure.

## Moving from source to target.

- Take backups of everything.
- Configure both backends to pdns.conf, if you have source configured, you can just add target backend. **DO NOT RESTART AUTH SERVER BEFORE YOU HAVE FINISHED**
- Then run `pdnsutil b2b-migrate old new`, the old and new being configuration prefixes in pdns.conf. If something goes wrong, make sure you properly clear **ALL** data from target backend before retrying.
- Remove (or comment out) old backend from pdns.conf, and run `pdnsutil rectify-all-zones` and `pdnsutil check-all-zones` to make sure everything is OK.
- If everything is OK, then go ahead to restart your PowerDNS service. Check logs to make sure everything went ok.
