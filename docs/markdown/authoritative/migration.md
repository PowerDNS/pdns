# Migrating to PowerDNS
Before migrating to PowerDNS a few things should be considered.

PowerDNS does not operate as a 'slave' or 'master' server with all backends.
Only the [Generic SQL](backend-generic-mypgsql.md), [BIND](backend-bind.md) backends have the ability to act as master or slave.

To migrate, the `zone2sql` tool is provided. There are also scripts from external contributors for migrating from `MyDNS` server. See https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/wiki/Migrating-DBs-FROM-MyDNS for details. 

Additionally, the PowerDNS source comes with a number of diagnostic tools, which can be helpful in verifying proper PowerDNS operation, versus incumbent nameservers. See [Tools to analyse DNS traffic](../tools/analysis.md) for more details.

# Zone2sql
`zone2sql` parses BIND `named.conf` files and zone files and outputs SQL on standard out, which can then be fed to your database.
It understands the Bind master file extension `$GENERATE` and will also honour `$ORIGIN` and `$TTL`.

For backends supporting slave operation (currently only the Generic PostgreSQL, Generic MySQL and BIND backend), there is also an option to keep slave zones as slaves, and not convert them to native operation.

`zone2sql` can generate SQL for the Generic PostgreSQL, Generic MySQL and Oracle backends. The following commands are available:

## `--bare`
Output in a bare format, suitable for further parsing. The output is formatted as follows:

```
          domain_id<TAB>'qname'<TAB>'qtype'<TAB>'content'<TAB>prio<TAB>ttl
```

## `--gmysql`
Output in format suitable for the default configuration of the Generic MySQL backend.

## `--gpgsql`
Output in format suitable for the default configuration of the Generic PostgreSQL backend.

## `--help`
List options.

## `--named-conf`
Parse this named.conf to find locations of zones.

## `--on-error-resume-next`
Ignore missing files during parsing. Dangerous.

## `--oracle`
Output in format suitable for the default configuration of the Generic Oracle backend.

## `--slave`
Maintain slave status of zones listed in named.conf as being slaves. The default behaviour is to convert all zones to native operation.

## `--transactions`
For Oracle and PostgreSQL output, wrap each domain in a transaction for higher speed and integrity.

## `--verbose`
Be verbose during conversion.

## `--zone`
Parse only this zone file. Conflicts with `--named-conf` parameter.

## `--zone-name`
When parsing a single zone without $ORIGIN statement, set this as the zone name.
