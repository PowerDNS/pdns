This backend allows visitors to be sent to a server closer to them, with no appreciable delay, as would otherwise be incurred with a protocol level redirect. Additionally, the Geo Backend can be used to provide service over several clusters, any of which can be taken out of use easily, for example for maintenance purposes. This backend can utilize EDNS Client Subnet extension for decision making, if provided in query and you have turned on (edns-subnet-processing)[settings.md#edns-subnet-processing].

## Prerequisites
To compile the backend, you need libyaml-cpp 0.5 or later and libgeoip.

You must have geoip database available. As of writing, on debian/ubuntu systems, you can use apt-get install geoip-database to get one, and the backend is configured to use the location where these files are installed as source. On other systems you might need to alter the database-file and database-file6 attribute. If you don't need ipv4 or ipv6 support, set the respective setting to "". Leaving it unset leaves it pointing to default location, preventing the software from starting up.

## Configuration Parameters
These are the configuration file parameters that are available for the GeoIP backend. geoip-zones-files is the only thing you must set, if the defaults suite you.

### `geoip-database-file`
Before 4.0.0. Specifies the full path of the data file for IPv4 to use.

### `geoip-database-file6`
Before 4.0.0. Specifies the full path of the data file for IPv6 to use.

### `geoip-database-files`
After 4.0.0. Comma, tab or space separated list of files to open. You can use [geoip-cvs-to-dat](https://github.com/dankamongmen/sprezzos-world/blob/master/packaging/geoip/debian/src/geoip-csv-to-dat.cpp) to generate your own.

### `geoip-database-cache`
Specifies the kind of caching that is done on the database. This is one of
"standard", "memory", "index" or "mmap". These options map to the caching
options described [here](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c/blob/master/README.md#memory-caching-and-other-options)

### `geoip-zones-file`
Specifies the full path of the zone configuration file to use.

### `geoip-dnssec-keydir`
Specifies the full path of a directory that will contain DNSSEC keys. This option enables DNSSEC on the backend. Keys can be created/managed with `pdnsutil`, and the backend stores these keys in files with key flags and active/disabled state encoded in the key filenames.

## Zonefile format
Zone configuration file uses YAML syntax. Here is simple example. Note that the ‐ before certain keys is part of the syntax.

Before 4.0.0:

```
domains:
- domain: geo.example.com
  ttl: 30
  records:
    geo.example.com:
      - soa: ns1.example.com hostmaster.example.com 2014090125 7200 3600 1209600 3600
      - ns: ns1.example.com
      - ns: ns2.example.com
      - mx: 10 mx.example.com
    fin.eu.service.geo.example.com:
      - a: 192.0.2.1
      - txt: hello world
      - aaaa: 2001:DB8::12:34DE:3
  services:
    service.geo.example.com: '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com'
```

From 4.0.0:

```
domains:
- domain: geo.example.com
  ttl: 30
  records:
    geo.example.com:
      - soa: ns1.example.com hostmaster.example.com 2014090125 7200 3600 1209600 3600
      - ns:
           content: ns1.example.com
           ttl: 600
      - ns: ns2.example.com
      - mx: 10 mx.example.com
    fin.eu.service.geo.example.com:
      - a: 192.0.2.2
      - txt: hello world
      - aaaa: 2001:DB8::12:34DE:3
# this will result first record being handed out 30% of time
    swe.eu.service.geo.example.com:
      - a:
           content: 192.0.2.3
           weight: 50
      - a: 192.0.2.4
  services:
# syntax 1
    service.geo.example.com: '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com'
# syntax 2
    service.geo.example.com: [ '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com', '%cn.service.geo.example.com']
# alternative syntax
  services:
    service.geo.example.com:
      default: [ '%co.%cn.service.geo.example.com', '%cn.service.geo.example.com' ]
      10.0.0.0/8: 'internal.service.geo.example.com'
```

### Keys explained
* **domains**: Mandatory root key. All configuration is below this
* **domain**: Defines a domain. You need ttl, records, services under this.
* **ttl**: TTL value for all records
* **records**: Put fully qualified name as subkey, under which you must define at least soa: key. Note that this is an array of records, so ‐ is needed for the values.
* **services**: Defines one or more services for querying. The format supports following placeholders, %% = %, %co = 3-letter country, %cn = continent, %af = v4 or v6. There are also other specifiers that will only work with suitable database and currently are untested. These are %re = region, %na = Name (such as, organisation), %ci = City. 
* From 4.1.0, you can also use %cc = 2 letter country code
* From 4.0.0, you can also use %as = ASn, %ip = Remote IP
* From 4.0.0, you can also use additional specifiers. These are %hh = hour, %dd = day, %mo = month, %mos = month as short string, %wd = weekday (as number), %wds weekday as short string. 
* From 4.0.0, scopeMask is set to most specific value, in case of date/time modifiers it will be 32 or 128, but with the others it is set to what geoip says it used for matching.
* From 4.0.0, You can add per-network overrides for format, they will be formatted with the same placeholders as default. Default is short-hand for adding 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0. Default is default when only string is given for service name.
* From 4.0.0, You can use array to specify return values, works only if you have those records specified. It matches the format results to your records, and if it finds match that is used. Otherwise the last is returned.
* From 4.0.0, You can apply all the attributes for the content of static records too.
* From 4.0.0, You can use record attributes to set TTL.
* From 4.0.0, You can use record attributes to define weight. If this is given, only one record is chosen randomly based on the weight. **DO NOT** mix record types for these. It will not work. PROBABILITY is calculated by summing up the weights and dividing each weight with the sum.
**WARNING**: If you use ip or time/date specifiers, caching will be disabled for that RR completely. That means, if you have a

  something.example.com:
    - a: 1.2.3.4
    - txt: "your ip is %ip"

then caching will not happen for any records of something.example.com. If you need to use TXT for debugging, make sure you use dedicated name for it.
