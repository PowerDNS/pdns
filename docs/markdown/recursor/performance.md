#Â PowerDNS Recursor performance
To get the best out of the PowerDNS recursor, which is important if you are doing thousands of queries per second, please consider the following.

-   Limit the size of the caches to a sensible value. Cache hit rate does not improve meaningfully beyond 4 million **max-cache-entries** per thread, reducing the memory footprint reduces CPU cache misses. See below for more information about the various caches.
-   Compile using g++ 4.1 or later. This compiler really does a good job on PowerDNS, much better than 3.4 or 4.0.
-   On AMD/Intel hardware, wherever possible, run a 64-bit binary. This delivers a nearly twofold performance increase. On UltraSPARC, there is no need to run with 64 bits.
-   Consider performing a 'profiled build' as described in the README. This is good for a 20% performance boost in some cases.
-   When running with &gt;3000 queries per second, and running Linux versions prior to 2.6.17 on some motherboards, your computer may spend an inordinate amount of time working around an ACPI bug for each call to gettimeofday. This is solved by rebooting with 'clock=tsc' or upgrading to a 2.6.17 kernel.

    The above is relevant if dmesg shows **Using pmtmr for high-res timesource**

-   A busy server may need hundreds of file descriptors on startup, and deals with spikes better if it has that many available later on. Linux by default restricts processes to 1024 file descriptors, which should suffice most of the time, but Solaris has a default limit of 256. This can be raised using the ulimit command. FreeBSD has a default limit that is high enough for even very heavy duty use.
-   When deploying (large scale) IPv6, please be aware some Linux distributions leave IPv6 routing cache tables at very small default values. Please check and if necessary raise 'sysctl net.ipv6.route.max\_size'.
-   For older versions &lt;3.2: If you need it, try **--fork**, this will fork the daemon into two halves, allowing it to benefit from a second CPU. This feature almost doubles performance, but is a bit of a hack.
-   for 3.2 and higher, set 'threads' to your number of CPU cores (but values above 8 rarely improve performance).
-   For best PowerDNS Recursor performance, use a recent version of your operating system, since this generally offers the best event multiplexer implementation available (kqueue, epoll, ports or /dev/poll).
-   A Recursor under high load puts a severe stress on any stateful (connection tracking) firewall, so much so that the firewall may fail.

    Specifically, many Linux distributions run with a connection tracking firewall configured. For high load operation (thousands of queries/second), It is advised to either turn off iptables completely, or use the 'NOTRACK' feature to make sure DNS traffic bypasses the connection tracking.

    Sample Linux command lines would be:

```
# iptables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j NOTRACK
# iptables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j NOTRACK
# iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j NOTRACK
# iptables -t raw -I PREROUTING -p udp --sport 53 -j NOTRACK
# iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -I INPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

    # # optionally
# ip6tables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j NOTRACK
# ip6tables -t raw -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j NOTRACK
# ip6tables -t raw -I PREROUTING -p udp --sport 53 -j NOTRACK
# ip6tables -t raw -I PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j NOTRACK
# ip6tables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
# ip6tables -I INPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
# ip6tables -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
```

Following the instructions above, you should be able to attain very high query rates.

## Recursor Caches
The PowerDNS Recursor contains a number of caches, or information stores:

### Nameserver speeds cache
The "NSSpeeds" cache contains the average latency to all remote authoritative servers.

### Negative cache
The "Negcache" contains all domains known not to exist, or record types not to exist for a domain.

### Recursor Cache
The Recursor Cache contains all DNS knowledge gathered over time.

### Packet Cache
The Packet Cache contains previous answers sent to clients. If a question comes in that matches a previous answer, this is sent back directly.

The Packet Cache is consulted first, immediately after receiving a packet. This means that a high hitrate for the Packet Cache automatically lowers the cache hitrate of subsequent caches. This explains why releases 3.2 and beyond see dramatically lower DNS cache hitrates, since this is the first version with a Packet Cache.
