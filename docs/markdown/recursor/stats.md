In the `pdns/tools/rrd/` subdirectory a number of rrdtool scripts is provided to
make nice graphs of all these numbers. Use `rec_control get-all` to get all
statistics in one go.

It should be noted that answers0-1 + answers1-10 + answers10-100 + answers100-1000 +
answers-slow + packetcache-hits + over-capacity-drops + policy-drops = questions.

Also note that unauthorized-tcp and unauthorized-udp packets do not end up in
the 'questions' count.

Every half hour or so, the recursor outputs a line with statistics. More
infrastructure is planned so as to allow for Cricket or MRTG graphs. To force
the output of statistics, send the process a SIGUSR1. A line of statistics looks
like this:

```
Feb 10 14:16:03 stats: 125784 questions, 13971 cache entries, 309 negative entries, 84% cache hits, outpacket/query ratio 37%, 12% throttled
```

This means that there are 13791 different names cached, which each may have
multiple records attached to them. There are 309 items in the negative cache,
items of which it is known that don't exist and won't do so for the near future.
84% of incoming questions could be answered without any additional queries going
out to the net.

The outpacket/query ratio means that on average, 0.37 packets were needed to
answer a question. Initially this ratio may be well over 100% as additional
queries may be needed to actually recurse the DNS and figure out the addresses
of nameservers.

Finally, 12% of queries were not performed because identical queries had gone out
previously, saving load on servers worldwide.
