Do note that only the PowerDNS software is in scope for the HackerOne program, not our websites or other infrastructure.

Disclosure Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
