Metrics and Statistics
======================

The PowerDNS Recursor collects many statistics about itself.

Regular Statistics Log
----------------------
Every half hour or so (configurable with :ref:`setting-statistics-interval`, the recursor outputs a line with statistics.
To force the output of statistics, send the process a SIGUSR1. A line of statistics looks like this::

    Feb 10 14:16:03 stats: 125784 questions, 13971 cache entries, 309 negative entries, 84% cache hits, outpacket/query ratio 37%, 12% throttled

This means that there are 13791 different names cached, which each may have multiple records attached to them.
There are 309 items in the negative cache, items of which it is known that don't exist and won't do so for the near future.
84% of incoming questions could be answered without any additional queries going out to the net.

The outpacket/query ratio means that on average, 0.37 packets were needed to answer a question.
Initially this ratio may be well over 100% as additional queries may be needed to actually recurse the DNS and figure out the addresses of nameservers.

Finally, 12% of queries were not performed because identical queries had gone out previously, saving load on servers worldwide.

Sending metrics to Graphite/Metronome over Carbon
-------------------------------------------------
For carbon/graphite/metronome, we use the following namespace.
Everything starts with 'pdns.', which is then followed by the local hostname.
Thirdly, we add 'recursor' to signify the daemon generating the metrics.
This is then rounded off with the actual name of the metric. As an example: 'pdns.ns1.recursor.questions'.

Care has been taken to make the sending of statistics as unobtrusive as possible, the daemons will not be hindered by an unreachable carbon server, timeouts or connection refused situations.

To benefit from our carbon/graphite support, either install Graphite, or use our own lightweight statistics daemon, Metronome, currently available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ahupowerdns/metronome/>`_.

To enable sending metrics, set :ref:`setting-carbon-server`, possibly :ref:`setting-carbon-interval` and possibly :ref:`setting-carbon-ourname` in the configuration.

.. warning::

  If your hostname includes dots, they will be replaced by underscores so as not to confuse the namespace.

  If you include dots in :ref:`setting-carbon-ourname`, they will **not** be replaced by underscores.
  As PowerDNS assumes you know what you are doing if you override your hostname.

Sending metrics over SNMP
-------------------------
.. versionadded:: 4.1.0

The recursor can export statistics over SNMP and send traps from :doc:`Lua <lua-scripting/index>`, provided support is compiled into the Recursor and :ref:`setting-snmp-agent` set.

Getting Metrics from the Recursor
---------------------------------

Should Carbon not be the preferred way of receiving metric, several other techniques can be employed to retrieve metrics.

Using the Webserver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :doc:`API <http-api/index>` exposes a statistics endpoint at :http:get:`/api/v1/servers/:server_id/statistics`.
This endpoint exports all statistics in a single JSON document.

Using ``rec_control``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Metrics can also be gathered on the system itself by invoking :doc:`rec_control <manpages/rec_control>`::

   rec_control get-all

Single statistics can also be retrieved with the ``get`` command, e.g.::

  rec_control get all-outqueries

External programs can use this technique to scrape metrics.

.. _metricnames:

.. _stat-x-our-latency:

x-our-latency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. versionadded:: 4.1
  Not yet proven to be reliable

PowerDNS measures per query how much time has been spent waiting on authoritative servers.
In addition, the Recursor measures the total amount of time needed to answer a question.
The difference between these two durations is a measure of how much time was spent within PowerDNS.
This metric is the average of that difference, in microseconds.
