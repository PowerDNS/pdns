.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.11
  :released: 1st of February 2019

  Since Spectre/Meltdown, system calls have become more expensive.  This made exporting a very high number of protobuf messages costly, which is addressed in this release by reducing the number of syscalls per message.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 7434

    Add an option to export only responses over protobuf to the Lua :func:`protobufServer` directive.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 7430
    :tickets: 7428

    Reduce systemcall usage in protobuf logging.  (See #7428.)

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.10
  :released: 24th of January 2019

  This release fixes a bug when trying to build PowerDNS Recursor with protobuf support disabled, thus this release is only relevant to people building PowerDNS Recursor from source and not if you're installing it as a package from our repositories.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 7403

    PowerDNS Recursor release 4.1.9 introduced a call to the Lua :func:`ipfilter` hook that required access to the DNS header, but the corresponding variable was only declared when protobuf support had been enabled.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.9
  :released: 21st of January 2019

  This release fixes :doc:`Security Advisory 2019-01 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2019-01>` and :doc:`Security Advisory 2019-02 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2019-02>` that were recently discovered, affecting PowerDNS Recursor:
   - CVE-2019-3806, 2019-01: from 4.1.4 up to and including 4.1.8 ;
   - CVE-2019-3807, 2019-02: from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.8.

  The issues are:
    - CVE-2019-3806, 2019-01: Lua hooks are not properly applied to queries received over TCP in some specific combination of settings, possibly bypassing security policies enforced using Lua ;
    - CVE-2019-3807, 2019-02: records in the answer section of responses received from authoritative servers with the AA flag not set were not properly validated, allowing an attacker to bypass DNSSEC validation.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 7397

    Properly apply Lua hooks to TCP queries, even with pdns-distributes-queries set (CVE-2019-3806, PowerDNS Security Advisory :doc:`2018-01 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2019-01>`). Validates records in the answer section of responses with AA=0 (CVE-2019-3807, PowerDNS Security Advisory :doc:`2019-02 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2019-02>`).

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 7377
    :tickets: 7383

    Try another worker before failing if the first pipe was full

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.8
  :released: 26th of November 2018

  This release fixes :doc:`Security Advisory 2018-09 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-09>` that we recently discovered, affecting PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.1.7.

  The issue is that a remote attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds memory read via a crafted query, while computing the hash of the query for a packet cache lookup, possibly leading to a crash.

  When the PowerDNS Recursor is run inside a supervisor like supervisord or systemd, a crash will lead to an automatic restart, limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 7221

    Crafted query can cause a denial of service (CVE-2018-16855, PowerDNS Security Advisory :doc:`2018-09 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-09>`)

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.7
  :released: 9th of November 2018

  This release updates the mitigation for :doc:`Security Advisory 2018-07 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-07>`, reverting the EDNS fallback strictness increase. This is necessary because there are a lot of broken name servers on the Internet.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 7172

    Revert 'Keep the EDNS status of a server on FormErr with EDNS'

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 7174

    Refuse queries for all meta-types

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.6
  :released: 7th of November 2018

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 7159
    :tickets: 7158

  The full release notes can be read `on the blog <https://blog.powerdns.com/2018/01/22/powerdns-recursor-4-1-1/>`__.

  This is a release on the stable branch, containing a fix for the
  abovementioned security issue and several bug fixes from the
  development branch.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 6215

    Correctly handle ancestor delegation NSEC{,3} for children. Fixes
    the DNSSEC validation issue found in Knot Resolver, where a NSEC{3}
    ancestor delegation is wrongly use to prove the non-existence of a
    RR below the delegation.
    We already had the correct check for the exact owner name, but not
    for RRs below the delegation.
    (Security Advisory :doc:`2018-01 <../security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-01>`)

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 6209
    :tickets: 6212

    Fix to make ``primeHints`` threadsafe, otherwise there's a small
    chance on startup that the root-server IPs will be incorrect.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 6085
    :tickets: 6198

    Don't process records for another class than IN. We don't use
    records of another class than IN, but we used to store some of them
    in the cache which is useless. Just skip them.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 6092
    :tickets: 6199

    Fix the computation of the closest encloser for positive
    answers. When the positive answer is expanded from a wildcard with
    NSEC3, the closest encloser is not always parent of the qname,
    depending on the number of labels in the initial wildcard.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 6095
    :tickets: 6200

    Pass the correct buffer size to ``arecvfrom()``. The incorrect size

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0
  :released: 4th of December 2017

  This is the first release in the 4.1 train.

  The full release notes can be read `on the blog <https://blog.powerdns.com/2017/12/04/powerdns-recursor-4-1/>`__.

  This is a major release containing significant speedups (both in throughput and latency), enhanced capabilities and a highly conformant and robust DNSSEC validation implementation that is ready for heavy production use. In addition, our EDNS Client Subnet implementation now scales effortlessly to networks needing very fine grained scopes (as used by some ‘country sized’ service providers).

  - Improved DNSSEC support,
  - Improved documentation,
  - Improved RPZ support,
  - Improved EDNS Client Subnet support,
  - Support for Botan 2.x (and removal of support for Botan 1.10),
  - SNMP support,
  - Lua engine has gained access to more parts of the recursor,
  - CPU affinity can now be specified,
  - TCP Fast Open support,
  - New performance metrics.

  Changes since 4.1.0-rc3:

    Don't leak when the loading a public ECDSA key fails.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes

    When validating DNSKeys, the zone should be part of the signer.

.. changelog::
  :version: 4.1.0-rc3
  :released: 17th of November 2017

  The third Release Candidate adds support for Botan 2.x (and removes
  support for Botan 1.10!), has a lot of DNSSEC fixes, features a
  cleaned up web UI and has miscellaneous minor improvements.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5877
    :tickets: 1066

    Sort NS addresses by speed and remove old ones.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5498
    :tickets: 2250, 5797

    Add support for Botan 2.x and remove support for Botan 1.10.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes

    Purge ``nsSpeeds`` entries even if we get less than 2 new entries.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5889

    Prevent possible downgrade attacks in the recursor.

  .. change::
    :tags: Improvements
    :pullreq: 5876

    Print more details of trust anchors. In addition, the
    :ref:`setting-trace` output that mentions if data from authoritative
    servers gets accepted now also prints the TTL and clarifies the
    'place' number previously printed.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5885
    :tickets: 5882

    Split NODATA / NXDOMAIN NSEC wildcard denial proof of
    existence. Otherwise there is a very real risk that a NSEC will
    cover a more specific wildcard and we end up with what looks like a
    NXDOMAIN proof but is a NODATA one.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5904

    Fix incomplete validation of cached entries.

  .. change::
    :tags: DNSSEC, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5912

    Fix going Insecure on NSEC3 hashes with too many iterations, since
    we could have gone Bogus on a positive answer synthetized from a
    wildcard if the corresponding NSEC3 had more iterations that we were
    willing to accept, while the correct result is Insecure.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5881
    :tickets: 5618

    Add EDNS to truncated, servfail answers.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5616

    Better support for deleting entries in ``NetmaskTree`` and
    ``NetmaskGroup``.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5917

    Use ``_exit()`` when we really really want to exit, for example
    after a fatal error. This stops us dying while we die. A call to
    ``exit()`` will trigger destructors, which may paradoxically stop
    the process from exiting, taking down only one thread, but harming
    the rest of the process.

  .. change::
    :tags: Lua, DNSSEC, Improvements
    :pullreq: 5895
    :tickets: 5888

    Add the DNSSEC validation state to the ``DNSQuestion`` Lua object
    (although the ability to update the validation state from these
    hooks is postponed to after 4.1.0).

  .. change::
    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5930

    In the recursor secpoll code, we assumed the TXT record would be the
    first record first record we received. Sometimes it was the RRSIG,
    leading to a silent error, and no secpoll check. Fixed the
    assumption, added an error.

  .. change::
    :tags: Internals, Bug Fixes

    Allow the use of a 'self-resolving' NS if cached A / AAAA
    exists. Before this, we could skip a perfectly valid NS for which we
    had retrieved the A and / or AAAA entries, for example via a glue.

    :tags: Bug Fixes
    :pullreq: 5961

    Add the config-name argument to the definition of configname. There
    was a bug where the config-name parameter was not used to change the
    path of the config file. This meant that some commands via
    rec_control (e.g. reload-acls) would fail when run against a
    recursor which had config-name defined. The correct behaviour was
    present in some, but not all, definitions of configname. (@jake2184)
