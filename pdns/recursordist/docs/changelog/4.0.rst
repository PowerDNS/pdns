PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.6
-----------------------

Released 6th of July 2017

This release features a fix for the ed25519 verifier.

Also on the Elliptic Curve front, support was added for ED448 (DNSSEC algorithm 16) by using libdecaf.

Besides that, this release features massive improvements to our edns-client-subnet handling, and some IXFR fixes.
Note that this release changes :ref:`setting-use-incoming-edns-subnet` to disabled by default.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.2
-----------------------

Released August 26th 2016

This release fixes a regression in 4.x where CNAME records for DNSSEC
signed domains were not sorted before the final answers, leading to some
clients (notably some versions of Chrome) not being able to extract the
required answer from the packet. This happened exclusively for DNSSEC
signed domains, but the problem happens even for clients not requesting
DNSSEC validation.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.0
-----------------------

Released July 11th 2016

PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.0 is part of `the great 4.x "Spring
Cleaning" <https://blog.powerdns.com/2015/11/28/powerdns-spring-cleaning/>`__
of PowerDNS which lasted through the end of 2015.

As part of the general cleanup, we did the following:

-  Moved to C++ 2011, a cleaner more powerful version of C++ that has
   allowed us to `improve the quality of
   implementation <http://bert-hubert.blogspot.nl/2015/01/on-c2011-quality-of-implementation.html>`__
   in many places.
-  Implemented dedicated infrastructure for dealing with DNS names that
   is fully "DNS Native" and needs less escaping and unescaping
-  Switched to binary storage of DNS records in all places
-  Moved ACLs to a dedicated Netmask Tree
-  Implemented a version of
   `RCU <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update>`__ for
   configuration changes
-  Instrumented our use of the memory allocator, reduced number of
   malloc calls substantially.
-  The Lua hook infrastructure was redone using LuaWrapper; old scripts
   will no longer work, but new scripts are easier to write under the
   new interface.

In addition to this cleanup, which has many internal benefits and solves
longstanding issues with escaped domain names, 4.0.0 brings the
following major new features:

-  RPZ aka Response Policy Zone support
-  IXFR slaving in the PowerDNS Recursor for RPZ
-  DNSSEC processing in Recursor (Authoritative has had this for years)
-  DNSSEC validation (without NSEC(3) proof validation)
-  EDNS Client Subnet support in PowerDNS Recursor (Authoritative has
   had this for years)
-  Lua asynchronous queries for per-IP/per-domain status
-  Caches that can now be wiped per whole zone instead of per name
-  Statistics on authoritative server response times (split for IPv4 and
   IPv6)
-  APIs are no longer marked as 'experimental' and had one final URL
   change
-  New metric: tcp-answer-bytes to measure DNS TCP/IP bandwidth, and
   many other new metrics

Please be aware that beyond the items listed here, there have been heaps
of tiny changes. As always, please carefully test a new release before
deploying it.

This release features the following fixes compared to rc1:

-  `#3989 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/3989>`__ Fix usage of
   std::distance() in DNSName::isPartOf() (signed/unsigned comparisons)
-  `#4017 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4017>`__ Fix building
   without Lua. Add ``isTcp`` to ``dq``.
-  `#4023 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4023>`__ Actually log
   on dnssec=log-fail
-  `#4028 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4028>`__ DNSSEC fixes
   (NSEC casing, send DO-bit over TCP, DNSSEC trace additions)
-  `#4052 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4052>`__ Don't fail
   configure on missing fcontext.hpp
-  `#4096 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4096>`__ Don't call
   ``commit()`` if we skipped all the records

It has the following improvements:

-  `#3400 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/3400>`__ Enable
   building on OpenIndiana
-  `#4016 <https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/pull/4016>`__ Log protobuf
   messages for cache hits. Add policy tags in gettag()
