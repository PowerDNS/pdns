EDNS bufsize in response packets
--------------------------------

You may have spotted the 512 in something like the following (after ``EDNS ... udp:``)::

  $ dig example.com @9.9.9.9
  
  ; <<>> DiG 9.11.5-P4-5.1+deb10u3-Debian <<>> example.com @9.9.9.9
  ;; global options: +cmd

and wonder 'why is the Recursor using a bufsize of 512? Did we not decide on a Flag Day, all together, that we would use 1232?'

The EDNS buffer size in a DNS packet, generated by side A, tells the recipient of that packet (side B) the maximum packet size that side A will accept from side B.
So, when the Recursor talks to an Authoritative, the Recursor reports the buffer size the Authoritative is allowed to use to it - usually 1232 (:ref:`setting-edns-outgoing-bufsize`).
But the example above is the Recursor responding to a client, and it is telling the client 'from you, I accept packets of up to 512 bytes'.
Or, to say it differently, the Recursor is telling the client that *questions* must fit in 512 bytes.
This is fine for the Recursor - unlike an Authoritative, that might need to handle big UPDATE requests, the Recursor really only answers simple questions from clients, and those always comfortably fit in 512 bytes, because the maximum length of a DNS name is 256 bytes.

Similarly, the maximum size of a response from the Recursor to a client is governed by the buffer size reported by the client, and the :ref:`setting-udp-truncation-threshold` setting in the Recursor configuration.

To see the buffer size the Recursor is reporting to authoritatives, ask an authoritative::

  $ dig txt header.lua.powerdns.org +short @9.9.9.9
  "id: 52938, aa: false, rd: false, ad: false, cd: false, do: true, ednsbufsiz: 1232, tcp: false"
