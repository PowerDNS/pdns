End of life statements
======================

We aim to have a release every six months.
The latest release receives correctness, stability and security updates.
The two releases before that get critical updates only.

Older releases are marked end of life and receive no updates at all.
Pre-releases do not receive immediate security updates.

The currently supported release train of the PowerDNS Recursor is 4.9.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.8 will only receive critical updates and will be
end of life after PowerDNS Recursor 4.11 or 5.1 is released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.7 will only receive critical updates and will be
end of life after PowerDNS Recursor 4.10 or 5.0 is released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.0 through 4.6, 3.x, and 2.x are End of Life.

Note: Users with a commercial agreement with PowerDNS.COM BV or Open-Xchange
can receive extended support for releases which are End Of Life. If you are
such a user, these EOL statements do not apply to you.

Note we did not have a very regular release schedule in the past,
so the dates for older releases do not follow the pattern described above.
