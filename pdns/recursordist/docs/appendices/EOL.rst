End of life statements
======================

We aim to have a major release every six months.
The latest major release train receives correctness, stability and security updates by the way of minor releases.
We support older releases with critical updates for one year after the following major release.

Older releases are marked end of life and receive no updates at all.
Pre-releases do not receive immediate security updates.

The currently supported release train of the PowerDNS Recursor is 4.9.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.8 will only receive critical updates and will be End of Life one year after PowerDNS Recursor 4.9 was released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.7 will only receive critical updates and will be End of Life one year after PowerDNS Recursor 4.8 was released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.0 through 4.6, 3.x, and 2.x are End of Life.

Note: Users with a commercial agreement with PowerDNS.COM BV or Open-Xchange
can receive extended support for releases which are End Of Life. If you are
such a user, these EOL statements do not apply to you.
Please refer to the support `commitment
<https://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=PowerDNS:Version_Support_Commitment>`_
for details.
Note that for the Open Source support channels we only support the latest minor release of a release train.
That means that we ask you to reproduce potential issues on the latest minor release first.

Note we did not have a very regular release schedule in the past,
so the dates for older releases do not follow the pattern described above.
