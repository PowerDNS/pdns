dnsdist
-------
`dnsdist` is a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer. Its goal in
life is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance
to legitimate users while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.

`dnsdist` is dynamic, in the sense that its configuration can be changed at
runtime, and that its statistics can be queried from a console-like
interface.

WARNING: `dnsdist` is still under HEAVY development, but we are giving it some
publicity in hopes of getting constructive feedback that will help us guide
our feature set.

Do not quite yet take this into production, but please DO let us know your
thoughts!  Test packages and/or tarballs can be found on
http://xs.powerdns.com/dnsdist/

Compiling
---------
`dnsdist` depends on boost, Lua or luajit and a pretty recent C++
compiler (g++ 4.8 or higher, clang 3.5). It can optionally use libsodium
for encrypted communications with its client.

To compile on CentOS 6 / RHEL6:

```
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/slc6-devtoolset.repo http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/devtoolset/slc6-devtoolset.repo
yum install devtoolset-2
scl enable devtoolset-2 bash
./configure
make
```

Packaged
--------
dnsdist has been packaged for FreeBSD and can be found on https://freshports.org/dns/dnsdist

Examples
--------

The absolute minimum configuration:

# dnsdist 2001:4860:4860::8888 8.8.8.8

This will listen on 0.0.0.0:53 and forward queries to the two listed IP
addresses, with a sensible load balancing policy.

Here is a more complete configuration:

```
$ cat /etc/dnsdist.conf
newServer {address="2001:4860:4860::8888", qps=1}
newServer {address="2001:4860:4860::8844", qps=1} 
newServer {address="2620:0:ccc::2", qps=10}
newServer {address="2620:0:ccd::2", qps=10}
newServer("192.168.1.2")
setServerPolicy(firstAvailable) -- first server within its QPS limit

$ dnsdist --local=0.0.0.0:5200 --daemon=no
Marking downstream [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2620:0:ccc::2]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream [2620:0:ccd::2]:53 as 'up'
Marking downstream 192.168.1.2:53 as 'up'
Listening on 0.0.0.0:5200
> 
```

We can now send queries to port 5200, and get answers:

```
$ dig -t aaaa powerdns.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5200 +short
2001:888:2000:1d::2
```

Note that dnsdist offered us a prompt above, and on it we can get some
statistics:

```
> showServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim Ord Wt    Queries   Drops Drate   Lat Pools
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53    up     0.0       1   1  1          1       0   0.0   0.0

3   [2620:0:ccd::2]:53           up     0.0      10   1  1          0       0   0.0   0.0
4   192.168.1.2:53               up     0.0       0   1  1          0       0   0.0   0.0
All                                     0.0                         1       0     
```

Here we also see our configuration. 5 downstream servers have been configured, of
which the first 4 have a QPS limit (of 1, 1, 10 and 10 queries per second,
respectively). The final server has no limit, which we can easily test:

```
$ for a in {0..1000}; do dig powerdns.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5200 +noall > /dev/null; done
> showServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim Ord Wt    Queries   Drops Drate   Lat Pools
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53    up     1.0       1   1  1          7       0   0.0   1.6
1   [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53    up     1.0       1   1  1          6       0   0.0   0.6
2   [2620:0:ccc::2]:53           up    10.3      10   1  1         64       0   0.0   2.4
3   [2620:0:ccd::2]:53           up    10.3      10   1  1         63       0   0.0   2.4
4   192.168.1.2:53               up   125.8       0   1  1        671       0   0.0   0.4
All                                   145.0                       811       0     
```

Note that the first 4 servers were all limited to near their configured QPS,
and that our final server was taking up most of the traffic. No queries were
dropped, and all servers remain up.

To force a server down, try:

```
> getServer(0):setDown()
> showServers()
#   Address                   State     Qps    Qlim Ord Wt    Queries   Drops Drate   Lat Pools
0   [2001:4860:4860::8888]:53  DOWN     0.0       1   1  1          8       0   0.0   0.0 
...
```

The 'DOWN' in all caps means it was forced down. A lower case 'down'
would've meant that dnsdist itself had concluded the server was down.
Similarly, setUp() forces a server to be up, and setAuto() returns it to the
default availability-probing.

To change the QPS for a server:
```
> getServer(0):setQPS(1000)
```

Webserver
---------
To visually interact with dnsdist, try adding:
```
webserver("127.0.0.1:8083", "supersecret")
```

to the configuration, and point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8083 and
log in with any username, and that password. Enjoy!

Server pools
------------
Now for some cool stuff. Let's say we know we're getting a whole bunch of
traffic for a domain used in DoS attacks, for example 'sh43354.cn'. We can
do two things with this kind of traffic. Either we block it outright, like
this:

```
> addDomainBlock("sh43354.cn.")
```

Or we configure a server pool dedicated to receiving the nasty stuff:

```
> newServer{address="192.168.1.3", pool="abuse")
> addPoolRule({"sh43353.cn.", "ezdns.it."}, "abuse")
```

The wonderful thing about this last solution is that it can also be used for
things where a domain might possibly be legit, but it is still causing load
on the system and slowing down the internet for everyone. With such an abuse
server, 'bad traffic' still gets a chance of an answer, but without
impacting the rest of the world (too much).

We can similarly add clients to the abuse server:

```
> addPoolRule({"192.168.12.0/24", "192.168.13.14"}, "abuse")
```

To define a pool that should receive a QPS-limited amount of traffic, do:

```
> addQPSPoolRule("com.", 10000, "gtld-cluster")
```


Both `addDomainBlock` and `addPoolRule` end up the list of Rules 
and Actions (for which see below).

Servers can be added or removed to pools with:
```
> getServer(7):addPool("abuse")
> getServer(4):rmPool("abuse")
```


Rules
-----
Rules can be inspected with `showRules()`, and can be deleted with
`rmRule()`.  Rules are evaluated in order, and this order can be changed
with `mvRule(from, to)` (see below for exact semantics).

Rules have selectors and actions. Current selectors are:
 * Source address
 * Query type
 * Query domain

Current actions are:
 * Drop
 * Route to a pool
 * Return with TC=1 (truncated, ie, instruction to retry with TCP)
 * Force a ServFail, NotImp or Refused answer
 * Send out a crafted response (NXDOMAIN or "real" data)
 * Delay a response by n milliseconds

More power
----------
More powerful things can be achieved by defining a function called
`blockFilter()` in the configuration file, which can decide to drop traffic
on any reason it wants. If you return 'true' from there, the query will get
blocked.

A demo on how to do this and many other things can be found on
https://github.com/ahupowerdns/pdns/blob/dnsname/pdns/dnsdistconf.lua and 
the exact definition of `blockFilter()` is at the end of this document.

ANY or whatever to TC
---------------------
The `blockFilter()` also gets passed read/writable copy of the DNS Header.
If you invoke setQR(1) on that, dnsdist knows you turned the packet into
a response, and will send the answer directly to the original client.

If you also called setTC(1), this will tell the remote client to move to
TCP/IP, and in this way you can implement ANY-to-TCP even for downstream
servers that lack this feature.

Note that calling `addAnyTCRule()` achieves the same thing, without
involving Lua.

Lua actions in rules
--------------------
While we can pass every packet through the `blockFilter()` functions, it is also
possible to configure `dnsdist` to only hand off some packets for Lua inspection. 
If you think Lua is too slow for your query load, or if you are doing heavy processing in Lua, 
this may make sense.

To select specific packets for Lua attention, use `addLuaAction(x, func)`,
where x is either a netmask, or a domain suffix, or a table of netmasks or a
table of domain suffixes.  This is identical to how `addPoolRule()` selects.

The function should look like this:
```
function luarule(remote, qname, qtype, dh, len)
        if(qtype==35) -- NAPTR
        then
                return DNSAction.Pool, "abuse" -- send to abuse pool
        else
                return DNSAction.None, ""      -- no action
        end
end
```

DNSSEC
------
To provide DNSSEC service from a separate pool, try:
```
newServer{address="2001:888:2000:1d::2", pool="dnssec"}
newServer{address="2a01:4f8:110:4389::2", pool="dnssec"}
setDNSSECPool("dnssec")
topRule()
```

This routes all queries with a DNSSEC OK (DO) or CD bit set to on to the "dnssec" pool.
The final `topRule()` command moves this rule to the top, so it gets evaluated first.

Inspecting live traffic
-----------------------
This is still much in flux, but for now, try:

 * `topQueries(20)`: shows the top-20 queries
 * `topQueries(20,2)`: shows the top-20 two-level domain queries (so `topQueries(20,1)` only shows TLDs)
 * `topResponses(20, 2)`: top-20 servfail responses (use ,3 for NXDOMAIN)


Live histogram of latency
-------------------------
```
> showResponseLatency()
Average response latency: 78.84 msec

```

Where : stands for 'half a star' and . for 'less than half a star, but
something was there'.

Per domain or subnet QPS limiting
---------------------------------
If certain domains or source addresses are generating onerous amounts of
traffic, you can put ceilings on the amount of traffic you are willing to
forward:

```
> addQPSLimit("h4xorbooter.xyz.", 10)
> addQPSLimit({"130.161.0.0/16", "145.14.0.0/16"} , 20)
> addQPSLimit({"nl.", "be."}, 1)
> showRules()
#     Matches Rule                                               Action
0           0 h4xorbooter.xyz.                                   qps limit to 10
1           0 130.161.0.0/16, 145.14.0.0/16                      qps limit to 20
2           0 nl., be.                                           qps limit to 1
```

To delete a limit (or a rule in general):
```
> rmRule(1)
> showRules()
#     Matches Rule                                               Action
0           0 h4xorbooter.xyz.                                   qps limit to 10
1           0 nl., be.                                           qps limit to 1
```

Delaying answers
----------------
Sometimes, runaway scripts will hammer your servers with back-to-back
queries.  While it is possible to drop such packets, this may paradoxically
lead to more traffic. 

An attractive middleground is to delay answers to such back-to-back queries,
causing a slowdown on the side of the source of the traffic.

To do so, use:
```
> addDelay("yourdomain.in.ua.", 500)
> addDelay({"65.55.37.0/24"}, 500)
```
This will delay responses for questions to the mentioned domain, or coming
from the configured subnet, by half a second.

Like the QPSLimits and other rules, the delaying instructions can be
inspected or edited using showRule(), rmRule(), topRule(), mvRule() etc.

Dynamic load balancing
----------------------
The default load balancing policy is called 'leastOutstanding', which means 
we pick the server with the least queries 'in the air'. 

Another policy, 'firstAvailable', picks the first server that has not
exceeded its QPS limit gets the traffic.  

A further policy, 'wrandom' assigns queries randomly, but based on the
'weight' parameter passed to `newServer` 

If you don't like the default policies you can create your own, like this
for example:

```
counter=0
function luaroundrobin(servers, remote, qname, qtype, dh) 
	 counter=counter+1
	 return servers[1+(counter % #servers)]
end

setServerPolicyLua("luaroundrobin", luaroundrobin)
```

Incidentally, this is similar to setting: `setServerPolicy(roundrobin)`
which uses the C++ based roundrobin policy.

Split horizon
-------------

To implement a split horizon, try:

```
authServer=newServer{address="2001:888:2000:1d::2", pool="auth"}

function splitSetup(servers, remote, qname, qtype, dh)
	 if(dh:getRD() == false)
	 then
		return leastOutstanding(getPoolServers("auth"), remote, qname, qtype, dh)
	 else
		return leastOutstanding(servers, remote, qname, qtype, dh)
	 end
end

setServerPolicyLua("splitsetup", splitSetup)
```

This will forward queries that don't want recursion to the pool of auth
servers, and will apply the default load balancing policy to all other
queries.

Running it for real
-------------------
First run on the command line, and generate a key:

```
# dnsdist --daemon-no
> makeKey()
setKey("sepuCcHcQnSAZgNbNPCCpDWbujZ5esZJmrt/wh6ldkQ=")
```
Now add this setKey line to `dnsdistconf.lua`, and also add:

```
controlSocket("0.0.0.0") -- or add portnumber too
```

Then start `dnsdist` as a daemon, and then connect to it:
```
# dnsdist
# dnsdist --client
> 
```

ACL, who can use dnsdist
------------------------
For safety reasons, by default only private networks can use dnsdist, see below
how to query and change the ACL:

```
> showACL()
127.0.0.0/8
10.0.0.0/8
(...)
::1/128
fc00::/7
fe80::/10
> addACL("130.161.0.0/16")
> setACL({"::/0"}) -- resets the list to this array
> showACL()
::/0
```

Carbon/Graphite/Metronome
-------------------------
To emit metrics to Graphite, or any other software supporting the Carbon protocol, use:
```
carbonServer('ip-address-of-carbon-server', 'ourname', 30)
```

Where 'ourname' can be used to override your hostname, and '30' is the
reporting interval in seconds.  The last two arguments can be omitted.  The
latest version of [PowerDNS
Metronome](https://github.com/ahupowerdns/metronome) comes with attractive
graphs for dnsdist by default.

All functions and types
-----------------------
Within `dnsdist` several core object types exist:
 * Server: generated with newServer, represents a downstream server
 * ComboAddress: represents an IP address and port
 * DNSName: represents a domain name
 * NetmaskGroup: represents a group of netmasks
 * QPSLimiter: implements a QPS-based filter
 * SuffixMatchNode: represents a group of domain suffixes for rapid testing of membership
 * DNSHeader: represents the header of a DNS packet

The existence of most of these objects can mostly be ignored, unless you
plan to write your own hooks and policies, but it helps to understand an
expressions like:

```
> getServer(0).order=12         -- set order of server 0 to 12
> getServer(0):addPool("abuse") -- add this server to the abuse pool
```
The '.' means 'order' is a data member, while the ':' meand addPool is a member function.

   * NetmaskGroup related
     * nothing yet
   * QPSLimiter related:
     * `newQPSLimiter(rate, burst)`: configure a QPS limiter with that rate and that burst capacity
     * member `check()`: check if this QPSLimiter has a token for us. If yes, you must use it.
   * SuffixMatchNode related:
     * newSuffixMatchNode(): returns a new SuffixMatchNode
     * member `check(DNSName)`: returns true if DNSName is matched by this group
     * member `add(DNSName)`: add this DNSName to the node

All hooks
---------
`dnsdist` can call Lua per packet if so configured, and will do so with the following hooks:

  * `bool blockfilter(ComboAddress, DNSName, qtype, DNSHeader)`: if defined, called for every function. If this
    returns true, the packet is dropped. If false is returned, `dnsdist` will check if the DNSHeader indicates
    the packet is now a query response. If so, `dnsdist` will answer the client directly with the modified packet.
  * `server policy(candidates, ComboAddress, DNSName, qtype, DNSHeader)`: if configured with `setServerPolicyLua()` 
    gets called for every packet. Candidates is a table of potential servers to pick from, ComboAddress is the 
    address of the requestor, DNSName and qtype describe name and type of query. DNSHeader meanwhile is available for 
    your inspection.
