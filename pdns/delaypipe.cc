       So we have a set of work to do, and we need to wait until the time arrives to do it.
       Simultaneously new work might come in. So we try to combine both of these things by
       setting a timeout on listening to the pipe over which new work comes in. This timeout
       is equal to the wait until the first thing that needs to be done.

       Two additional cases exist: we have no work to wait for, so we can wait infinitely long.
       The other special case is that the first we have to do.. is in the past, so we need to do it
       immediately. */
