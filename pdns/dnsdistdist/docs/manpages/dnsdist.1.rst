Synopsis
--------

dnsdist [<option>...] [address]...

Description
-----------

:program:`dnsdist` receives DNS queries and relays them to one or more
downstream servers. It subsequently sends back responses to the original
requestor.

:program:`dnsdist` operates over TCP and UDP, and strives to deliver very high
performance over both.

Currently, queries are sent to the downstream server with the least
outstanding queries. This effectively implies load balancing, making
sure that slower servers get less queries.

If a reply has not come in after a few seconds, it is removed from the
queue, but in the short term, timeouts do cause a server to get less
traffic.

IPv4 and IPv6 operation can be mixed and matched, in other words,
queries coming in over IPv6 could be forwarded to IPv4 and vice versa.

:program:`dnsdist` is scriptable in Lua, see the dnsdist documentation for more
information on this.

Scope
-----

:program:`dnsdist` does not 'think' about DNS queries, it restricts itself to
measuring response times and error codes and routing questions
accordingly. It comes with a very high performance packet-cache.

The goal for dnsdist is to remain simple. If more powerful loadbalancing
is required, dedicated hardware or software is recommended. Linux
Virtual Server for example is often mentioned.

Options
-------

-a <netmask>, --acl <netmask>          Add *netmask* to the ACL.
-C <file>, --config <file>             Load configuration from *file*.
--check-config                         Test the configuration file (which may be set with **--config** or **-C**)
                                       for errors. dnsdist will show the errors and exit with a non-zero
                                       exit-code when errors are found.
-c <address>, --client <address>       Operate as a client, connect to dnsdist. This will read the dnsdist
                                       configuration for the **controlSocket** statement and connect to it.
                                       When *address* (with an optional port number) is set, dnsdist will connect
                                       to that instead.
-k <key>, --setkey <key>               When operating as a client(**-c**, **--client**), use *key* as
                                       shared secret to connect to dnsdist. This should be the same key
                                       that is used on the server (set with **setKey()**). Note that this
                                       will leak the key into your shell's history. Only available when
                                       dnsdist is compiled with libsodium support.
-e, --execute <command>                Connect to dnsdist and execute *command*.
-h, --help                             Display a helpful message and exit.
-l, --local <address>                  Bind to *address*, Supply as many addresses (using multiple
                                       **--local** statements) to listen on as required. Specify IPv4 as
                                       0.0.0.0:53 and IPv6 as [::]:53.
--supervised                           Run in foreground, but do not spawn a console. Use this switch to
                                       run dnsdist inside a supervisor (use with e.g. systemd and
                                       daemontools).
--disable-syslog                       Disable logging to syslog. Use this when running inside a supervisor
                                       that handles logging (like systemd).
-u, --uid <uid>                        Change the process user to *uid* after binding sockets. *uid* can be
                                       a name or number.
-g, --gid <gid>                        Change the process group to *gid* after binding sockets. *gid* Can
                                       be a name or number.
-V, --version                          Show the dnsdist version and exit.
-v, --verbose                          Be verbose.

**address** are any number of downstream DNS servers, in the same syntax as used
with **--local**. If the port is not specified, 53 is used.

Bugs
----

Right now, the TCP support has some rather arbitrary limits.
