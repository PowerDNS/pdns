Packet Policies
===============

:program:`dnsdist` works in essence like any other loadbalancer:

It receives packets on one or several addresses it listens on, and determines whether it will process this packet based on the :doc:`advanced/acl`. Should the packet be processed, :program:`dnsdist` attempts to match any of the configured rules in order and when one matches, the associated action is performed.

These rule and action combinations are considered policies.

Packet Actions
--------------

Each packet can be:

- Dropped
- Turned into an answer directly
- Forwarded to a downstream server
- Modified and forwarded to a downstream and be modified back
- Be delayed

This decision can be taken at different times during the forwarding process.
All packets not handled by an explicit action are forwarded to a downstream server in the default pool.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Rules for traffic exceeding QPS limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traffic that exceeds a QPS limit, in total or per IP (subnet) can be matched by a rule.

For example::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5, 32, 48), DelayAction(100))

This measures traffic per IPv4 address and per /48 of IPv6, and if traffic for such an address (range) exceeds 5 qps, it gets delayed by 100ms. (Please note: :func:`DelayAction` can only delay UDP traffic). 

As another example::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), SetNoRecurseAction())

This strips the Recursion Desired (RD) bit from any traffic per IPv4 or IPv6 /64 that exceeds 5 qps.
This means any those traffic bins is allowed to make a recursor do 'work' for only 5 qps.

If this is not enough, try::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), DropAction())

or::

  addAction(AndRule{MaxQPSIPRule(5), TCPRule(false)}, TCAction())

This will respectively drop traffic exceeding that 5 QPS limit per IP or range, or return it with TC=1, forcing clients to fall back to TCP.

In that last one, note the use of :func:`TCPRule`.
Without it, clients would get TC=1 even if they correctly fell back to TCP.

To turn this per IP or range limit into a global limit, use ``NotRule(MaxQPSRule(5000))`` instead of :func:`MaxQPSIPRule`.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`RegexRule` matches a regular expression on the query name, and it works like this::

  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{5,}"), DelayAction(750)) -- milliseconds
  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{4,}\\.example$"), DropAction())

This delays any query for a domain name with 5 or more consecutive digits in it.
The second rule drops anything with more than 4 consecutive digits within a .example domain.

Note that the query name is presented without a trailing dot to the regex.
The regex is applied case insensitively.

Alternatively, if compiled in, :func:`RE2Rule` provides similar functionality, but against libre2.

Note that to check if a name is in a list of domains, :func:`SuffixMatchNodeRule` is preferred over complex regular expressions or multiple instances of :func:`RegexRule`.
The :func:`makeRule` convenience function can be used to create a :func:`SuffixMatchNodeRule`.

Rule Generators
---------------

:program:`dnsdist` contains several functions that make it easier to add actions and rules.

.. function:: addLuaAction(DNSrule, function [, options])

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.0
    Removed in 1.4.0, use :func:`LuaAction` with :func:`addAction` instead.

  Invoke a Lua function that accepts a :class:`DNSQuestion`.
  This function works similar to using :func:`LuaAction`.
  The ``function`` should return both a :ref:`DNSAction` and its argument `rule`. The `rule` is used as an argument
  of the following :ref:`DNSAction`: `DNSAction.Spoof`, `DNSAction.Pool` and `DNSAction.Delay`.
  If the Lua code fails, ServFail is returned.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param string function: the name of a Lua function
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``uuid``: string - UUID to assign to the new rule. By default a random UUID is generated for each rule.

  ::

    function luaaction(dq)
      if(dq.qtype==DNSQType.NAPTR)
      then
        return DNSAction.Pool, "abuse" -- send to abuse pool
      else
        return DNSAction.None, ""      -- no action
        -- return DNSAction.None       -- as of dnsdist version 1.3.0
      end
    end

    addLuaAction(AllRule(), luaaction)

.. function:: addLuaResponseAction(DNSrule, function [, options])

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.0
    Removed in 1.4.0, use :func:`LuaResponseAction` with :func:`addResponseAction` instead.

  Invoke a Lua function that accepts a :class:`DNSResponse`.
  This function works similar to using :func:`LuaResponseAction`.
  The ``function`` should return both a :ref:`DNSResponseAction` and its argument `rule`. The `rule` is used as an argument
  of the `DNSResponseAction.Delay`.
  If the Lua code fails, ServFail is returned.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param string function: the name of a Lua function
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``uuid``: string - UUID to assign to the new rule. By default a random UUID is generated for each rule.

  > addAction({"nl.", "be."}, QPSAction(1))
  > showRules()

  0           0 h4xorbooter.xyz.                                   qps limit to 10
  1           0 130.161.0.0/16, 145.14.0.0/16                      qps limit to 20
  2           0 nl., be.                                           qps limit to 1

.. function:: KeyValueStoreRangeLookupRule(kvs, lookupKey)

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Does a range-based lookup into the key value store referenced by 'kvs' using the key returned by 'lookupKey' and returns true if there is a range covering that key.

  This assumes that there is a key, in network byte order, for the last element of the range (for example 2001:0db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff for 2001:db8::/32) which contains the first element of the range (2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000) (optionally followed by any data) as value, still in network byte order, and that there is no overlapping ranges in the database.
  This requires that the underlying store supports ordered keys, which is true for LMDB but not for CDB.

  The function will be invoked in a per-thread Lua state, without access to the global Lua state. All constants (:ref:`DNSQType`, :ref:`DNSRCode`, ...) are available in that per-thread context,
  as well as all FFI functions. Objects and their bindings that are not usable in a FFI context (:class:`DNSQuestion`, :class:`DNSDistProtoBufMessage`, :class:`PacketCache`, ...)
  are not available.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
    ``shards`` parameter added

  Matches traffic for a subnet specified by ``v4Mask`` or ``v6Mask`` exceeding ``qps`` queries per second up to ``burst`` allowed.
  This rule keeps track of QPS by netmask or source IP. This state is cleaned up regularly if  ``cleanupDelay`` is greater than zero,
  removing existing netmasks or IP addresses that have not been seen in the last ``expiration`` seconds.

  :param int qps: The number of queries per second allowed, above this number traffic is matched
  :param int v4Mask: The IPv4 netmask to match on. Default is 32 (the whole address)
  :param int v6Mask: The IPv6 netmask to match on. Default is 64
  :param int burst: The number of burstable queries per second allowed. Default is same as qps
  :param int expiration: How long to keep netmask or IP addresses after they have last been seen, in seconds. Default is 300
  :param int cleanupDelay: The number of seconds between two cleanups. Default is 60
  :param int scanFraction: The maximum fraction of the store to scan for expired entries, for example 5 would scan at most 20% of it. Default is 10 so 10%
  :param int shards: How many shards to use, to decrease lock contention between threads. Default is 10 and is a safe default unless a very high number of threads are used to process incoming queries

.. function:: MaxQPSRule(qps)

  Matches traffic **not** exceeding this qps limit. If e.g. this is set to 50, starting at the 51st query of the current second traffic stops being matched.

  This can be used to differentiate between clients

  :param NetMaskGroup nmg: The NetMaskGroup to match on
  :param bool src: Whether to match source or destination address of the packet. Defaults to true (matches source)
  :param bool quiet: Do not display the list of matched netmasks in Rules. Default is false.

.. function:: RDRule()

  Matches queries with the RD flag set.

.. function:: RegexRule(regex)

  Matches the query name against the ``regex``.

  .. code-block:: Lua

    addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{5,}"), DelayAction(750)) -- milliseconds
    addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{4,}\\.example$"), DropAction())

  This delays any query for a domain name with 5 or more consecutive digits in it.

  might provide more consistent results.
  As of the version 2.3.0-beta of h2o, it is unfortunately not possible to extract the SNI value from DoH
  connections, and it is therefore necessary to use the HTTP Host header until version 2.3.0 is released.

  :param string rule: A string to convert to a rule.


Actions
-------

:ref:`RulesIntro` need to be combined with an action for them to actually do something with the matched packets.
Some actions allow further processing of rules, this is noted in their description. Most of these start with 'Set' with a few exceptions, mostly for logging actions. These exceptions are:

- :func:`ClearRecordTypesResponseAction`
- :func:`KeyValueStoreLookupAction`
- :func:`DnstapLogAction`
- :func:`DnstapLogResponseAction`
- :func:`LimitTTLResponseAction`
- :func:`LogAction`
- :func:`NoneAction`
- :func:`RemoteLogAction`
- :func:`RemoteLogResponseAction`
- :func:`SetMaxReturnedTTLResponseAction`
- :func:`SetMaxReturnedTTLAction`
- :func:`SetMinTTLResponseAction`
- :func:`SetMaxTTLResponseAction`
- :func:`SNMPTrapAction`
- :func:`SNMPTrapResponseAction`
- :func:`TeeAction`

The following actions exist.

.. function:: AllowResponseAction()

  Let these packets go through.

.. function:: ClearRecordTypesResponseAction(types)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Removes given type(s) records from the response. Beware you can accidentally turn the answer into a NODATA response
  without a SOA record in the additional section in which case you may want to use :func:`NegativeAndSOAAction` to generate an answer,
  see example bellow.
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  .. code-block:: Lua

    -- removes any HTTPS record in the response
    addResponseAction(
            QNameRule('www.example.com.'),
            ClearRecordTypesResponseAction(DNSQType.HTTPS)
    )
    -- reply directly with NODATA and a SOA record as we know the answer will be empty
    addAction(
            AndRule{QNameRule('www.example.com.'), QTypeRule(DNSQType.HTTPS)},
            NegativeAndSOAAction(false, 'example.com.', 3600, 'ns.example.com.', 'postmaster.example.com.', 1, 1800, 900, 604800, 86400)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    Added the optional parameter ``options``.

  Reply immediately by turning the query into a response with the specified EDNS extended ``rcode``.
  ``rcode`` can be specified as an integer or as one of the built-in :ref:`DNSRCode`.

  :param int rcode: The extended RCODE to respond with.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``aa``: bool - Set the AA bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to clear it.
  * ``ad``: bool - Set the AD bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to clear it.
  * ``ra``: bool - Set the RA bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to copy the value of the RD bit from the incoming query.

.. function:: KeyValueStoreLookupAction(kvs, lookupKey, destinationTag)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Does a lookup into the key value store referenced by 'kvs' using the key returned by 'lookupKey',
  and storing the result if any into the tag named 'destinationTag'.
  The store can be a CDB (:func:`newCDBKVStore`) or a LMDB database (:func:`newLMDBKVStore`).
  The key can be based on the qname (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeyQName` and :func:`KeyValueLookupKeySuffix`),
  source IP (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeySourceIP`) or the value of an existing tag (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeyTag`).
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.
  Note that the tag is always created, even if there was no match, but in that case the content is empty.

  :param KeyValueStore kvs: The key value store to query
  :param KeyValueLookupKey lookupKey: The key to use for the lookup
  :param string destinationTag: The name of the tag to store the result into

.. function:: KeyValueStoreRangeLookupAction(kvs, lookupKey, destinationTag)

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Does a range-based lookup into the key value store referenced by 'kvs' using the key returned by 'lookupKey',
  and storing the result if any into the tag named 'destinationTag'.
  This assumes that there is a key in network byte order for the last element of the range (for example 2001:0db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff for 2001:db8::/32) which contains the first element of the range (2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000) (optionally followed by any data) as value, also in network byte order, and that there is no overlapping ranges in the database.
  This requires that the underlying store supports ordered keys, which is true for LMDB but not for CDB.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param KeyValueStore kvs: The key value store to query
  :param KeyValueLookupKey lookupKey: The key to use for the lookup
  :param string destinationTag: The name of the tag to store the result into

.. function:: LimitTTLResponseAction(min[, max [, types]])

  Cap the TTLs of the response to the given boundaries.

  :param int min: The minimum allowed value
  :param int max: The maximum allowed value
  :param list of int: The record types to cap the TTL for. Default is empty which means all records will be capped.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
    Added the optional parameters ``verboseOnly`` and ``includeTimestamp``, made ``filename`` optional.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.7.0
    Added the ``reload`` method.

  Log a line for each query, to the specified ``file`` if any, to the console (require verbose) if the empty string is given as filename.

  If an empty string is supplied in the file name, the logging is done to stdout, and only in verbose mode by default. This can be changed by setting ``verboseOnly`` to false.

  When logging to a file, the ``binary`` optional parameter specifies whether we log in binary form (default) or in textual form. Before 1.4.0 the binary log format only included the qname and qtype. Since 1.4.0 it includes an optional timestamp, the query ID, qname, qtype, remote address and port.

  The ``append`` optional parameter specifies whether we open the file for appending or truncate each time (default).
  The ``buffered`` optional parameter specifies whether writes to the file are buffered (default) or not.

  Since 1.7.0 calling the ``reload()`` method on the object will cause it to close and re-open the log file, for rotation purposes.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param string filename: File to log to. Set to an empty string to log to the normal stdout log, this only works when ``-v`` is set on the command line.
  :param bool binary: Do binary logging. Default true
  :param bool append: Append to the log. Default false
  :param bool buffered: Use buffered I/O. Default true
  :param bool verboseOnly: Whether to log only in verbose mode when logging to stdout. Default is true
  :param bool includeTimestamp: Whether to include a timestamp for every entry. Default is false

  The ``append`` optional parameter specifies whether we open the file for appending or truncate each time (default).
  The ``buffered`` optional parameter specifies whether writes to the file are buffered (default) or not.

  Since 1.7.0 calling the ``reload()`` method on the object will cause it to close and re-open the log file, for rotation purposes.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param string filename: File to log to. Set to an empty string to log to the normal stdout log, this only works when ``-v`` is set on the command line.
  :param bool append: Append to the log. Default false
  :param bool buffered: Use buffered I/O. Default true
  :param bool verboseOnly: Whether to log only in verbose mode when logging to stdout. Default is true
  :param bool includeTimestamp: Whether to include a timestamp for every entry. Default is false
