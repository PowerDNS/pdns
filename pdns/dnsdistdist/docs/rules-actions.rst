Packet Policies
===============

dnsdist works in essence like any other loadbalancer:

It receives packets on one or several addresses it listens on, and determines whether it will process this packet based on the :doc:`advanced/acl`. Should the packet be processed, dnsdist attempts to match any of the configured rules in order and when one matches, the associated action is performed.

These rule and action combinations are considered policies.

Packet Actions
--------------

Each packet can be:

- Dropped
- Turned into an answer directly
- Forwarded to a downstream server
- Modified and forwarded to a downstream and be modified back
- Be delayed

This decision can be taken at different times during the forwarding process.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Rules for traffic exceeding QPS limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traffic that exceeds a QPS limit, in total or per IP (subnet) can be matched by a rule.

For example::

  addDelay(MaxQPSIPRule(5, 32, 48), 100)

This measures traffic per IPv4 address and per /48 of IPv6, and if traffic for such an address (range) exceeds 5 qps, it gets delayed by 100ms.

As another example::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), NoRecurseAction())

This strips the Recursion Desired (RD) bit from any traffic per IPv4 or IPv6 /64 that exceeds 5 qps.
This means any those traffic bins is allowed to make a recursor do 'work' for only 5 qps.

If this is not enough, try::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), DropAction())

or::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), TCAction())

This will respectively drop traffic exceeding that 5 QPS limit per IP or range, or return it with TC=1, forcing clients to fall back to TCP.

To turn this per IP or range limit into a global limit, use ``NotRule(MaxQPSRule(5000))`` instead of :func:`MaxQPSIPRule`.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`RegexRule` matches a regular expression on the query name, and it works like this::

  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{5,}"), DelayAction(750)) -- milliseconds
  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{4,}\\.example$"), DropAction())

This delays any query for a domain name with 5 or more consecutive digits in it.
The second rule drops anything with more than 4 consecutive digits within a .example domain.

Note that the query name is presented without a trailing dot to the regex.
The regex is applied case insensitively.

Alternatively, if compiled in, :func:`RE2Rule` provides similar functionality, but against libre2.

Rule Generators
---------------

:program:`dnsdist` contains several functions that make it easier to add actions and rules.

.. function:: addAnyTCRule()

  Set the TC-bit (truncate) on ANY queries received over UDP.
  Forcing a retry over TCP.
  This is equivalent to doing::

    addAction(AndRule({QTypeRule(dnsdist.ANY), TCPRule(false)}), TCAction())

.. function:: addDelay(DNSrule, delay)

  Delay the query for ``delay`` milliseconds before sending to a backend.

  :param DNSRule: The DNSRule to match traffic
  :param int delay: The delay time in milliseconds.

.. function:: addDisableValidationRule(DNSrule)

  Set the CD (Checking Disabled) flag to 1 for all queries matching the DNSRule.
  Using this function is equal to using the :func:`DisableValidationAction`.

.. function:: addDomainBlock(domain)

  Drop all queries for ``domain`` and all names below it.

  :param string domain: The domain name to block

.. function:: addDomainSpoof(domain, IPv4[, IPv6])
              addDomainSpoof(domain, {IP[,...]})

  Generate answers for A/AAAA/ANY queries.

  :param string domain: Domain name to spoof for
  :param string IPv4: IPv4 address to spoof in the reply

  :param string domain: Domain name to spoof for
  :param string cname: Domain name to add CNAME to

.. function:: addLuaAction(DNSrule, function)

  This function works similar to using :func:`LuaAction`.

  The ``function`` should return a :ref:`DNSAction`.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param string function: the name of a Lua function

.. function:: addLuaResponseAction(DNSrule, function)

  Invoke a Lua function that accepts a :class:`DNSQuestion` on the response.

  :param string function: the name of a Lua function

.. function:: addNoRecurseRule(DNSrule)

  Clear the RD flag for all queries matching the rule.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule

.. function:: addPoolRule(DNSRule, pool)

  Send queries matching the first argument to the pool ``pool``.
  e.g.::

    addPoolRule("example.com", "myPool")

  This is equivalent to::

    addAction("example.com", PoolAction("myPool"))

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param string pool: The name of the pool to send the queries to

.. function:: addQPSLimit(DNSrule, limit)

  Limit queries matching the DNSRule to ``limit`` queries per second.
  All queries over the limit are dropped.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param int limit: QPS limit for this rule

.. function:: addQPSPoolRule(DNSRule, limit, pool)

  Send at most ``limit`` queries/s for this pool, letting the subsequent rules apply otherwise.
  This is a convience function for the following syntax::

    addAction("192.0.2.0/24", QPSPoolAction(15, "myPool")

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule
  :param int limit: QPS limit for this rule
  :param string pool: The name of the pool to send the queries to
