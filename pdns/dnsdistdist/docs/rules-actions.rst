Packet Policies
===============

dnsdist works in essence like any other loadbalancer:

It receives packets on one or several addresses it listens on, and determines whether it will process this packet based on the :doc:`advanced/acl`. Should the packet be processed, dnsdist attempts to match any of the configured rules in order and when one matches, the associated action is performed.

These rule and action combinations are considered policies.

Packet Actions
--------------

Each packet can be:

- Dropped
- Turned into an answer directly
- Forwarded to a downstream server
- Modified and forwarded to a downstream and be modified back
- Be delayed

This decision can be taken at different times during the forwarding process.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Rules for traffic exceeding QPS limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traffic that exceeds a QPS limit, in total or per IP (subnet) can be matched by a rule.

For example::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5, 32, 48), DelayAction(100))

This measures traffic per IPv4 address and per /48 of IPv6, and if traffic for such an address (range) exceeds 5 qps, it gets delayed by 100ms. (Please note: :func:`DelayAction` can only delay UDP traffic). 

As another example::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), NoRecurseAction())

This strips the Recursion Desired (RD) bit from any traffic per IPv4 or IPv6 /64 that exceeds 5 qps.
This means any those traffic bins is allowed to make a recursor do 'work' for only 5 qps.

If this is not enough, try::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), DropAction())

or::

  addAction(MaxQPSIPRule(5), TCAction())

This will respectively drop traffic exceeding that 5 QPS limit per IP or range, or return it with TC=1, forcing clients to fall back to TCP.

To turn this per IP or range limit into a global limit, use ``NotRule(MaxQPSRule(5000))`` instead of :func:`MaxQPSIPRule`.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`RegexRule` matches a regular expression on the query name, and it works like this::

  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{5,}"), DelayAction(750)) -- milliseconds
  addAction(RegexRule("[0-9]{4,}\\.example$"), DropAction())

This delays any query for a domain name with 5 or more consecutive digits in it.
The second rule drops anything with more than 4 consecutive digits within a .example domain.

Note that the query name is presented without a trailing dot to the regex.
The regex is applied case insensitively.

Alternatively, if compiled in, :func:`RE2Rule` provides similar functionality, but against libre2.

Rule Generators
---------------

:program:`dnsdist` contains several functions that make it easier to add actions and rules.

.. function:: addAnyTCRule()

  .. deprecated:: 1.2.0

  Set the TC-bit (truncate) on ANY queries received over UDP, forcing a retry over TCP.
  This function is deprecated as of 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0. This is equivalent to doing::

   addAction(AndRule({QTypeRule(DNSQType.ANY), TCPRule(false)}), TCAction())

  .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
    Before 1.4.0, the QTypes were in the ``dnsdist`` namespace. Use ``dnsdist.ANY`` in these versions.

.. function:: addDelay(DNSrule, delay)

  .. deprecated:: 1.2.0

  Delay the query for ``delay`` milliseconds before sending to a backend.
  This function is deprecated as of 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0, please use instead:

    addAction(DNSRule, DelayAction(delay))

  :param DNSRule: The DNSRule to match traffic
  :param int delay: The delay time in milliseconds.

.. function:: addDisableValidationRule(DNSrule)

  .. deprecated:: 1.2.0

  Set the CD (Checking Disabled) flag to 1 for all queries matching the DNSRule.
  This function is deprecated as of 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0. Please use the :func:`DisableValidationAction` action instead.

.. function:: addDomainBlock(domain)

  .. deprecated:: 1.2.0

  Drop all queries for ``domain`` and all names below it.
  Deprecated as of 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0, please use instead:

.. function:: addDomainSpoof(domain, IPv4[, IPv6])
              addDomainSpoof(domain, {IP[,...]})

  This function is deprecated as of 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0, please use:

    addAction(domain, SpoofAction({IP[,...]}))

  or:

    addAction(domain, SpoofAction(IPv4[, IPv6]))

  :param string domain: Domain name to spoof for
  :param string IPv4: IPv4 address to spoof in the reply
  :param string IPv6: IPv6 address to spoof in the reply

    Removed in 1.4.0, use :func:`LuaAction` with :func:`addAction` instead.

  Invoke a Lua function that accepts a :class:`DNSQuestion`.
  This function works similar to using :func:`LuaAction`.
  The ``function`` should return both a :ref:`DNSAction` and its argument `rule`. The `rule` is used as an argument
  of the following :ref:`DNSAction`: `DNSAction.Spoof`, `DNSAction.Pool` and `DNSAction.Delay`.
  If the Lua code fails, ServFail is returned.

  :param DNSRule: match queries based on this rule

  Matches against the TLS Server Name Indication value sent by the client, if any. Only makes
  sense for DoT or DoH, and for that last one matching on the HTTP Host header using :func:`HTTPHeaderRule`
  might provide more consistent results.
  As of the version 2.3.0-beta of h2o, it is unfortunately not possible to extract the SNI value from DoH
  connections, and it is therefore necessary to use the HTTP Host header until version 2.3.0 is released.

  :param str name: The exact SNI name to match.
