Rules management
================

Incoming queries
----------------

For Rules related to the incoming query:

.. function:: addAction(DNSrule, action [, options])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    Added ``name`` to the ``options``.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
    Passing a string or list of strings instead of a :class:`DNSRule` is deprecated, use :func:`NetmaskGroupRule` or :func:`QNameSuffixRule` instead

  Add a Rule and Action to the existing rules.
  If a string (or list of) is passed as the first parameter instead of a :class:`DNSRule`, it behaves as if the string or list of strings was passed to :func:`NetmaskGroupRule` or :func:`SuffixMatchNodeRule`.

  :param DNSrule rule: A :class:`DNSRule`, e.g. an :func:`AllRule`, or a compounded bunch of rules using e.g. :func:`AndRule`. Before 1.9.0 it was also possible to pass a string (or list of strings) but doing so is now deprecated.
  :param action: The action to take
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``uuid``: string - UUID to assign to the new rule. By default a random UUID is generated for each rule.
  * ``name``: string - Name to assign to the new rule.

.. function:: clearRules()

  :param int from: Rule number to move
  :param int to: Location to more the Rule to

.. function:: mvRuleToTop()

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  This function moves the last rule to the first position. Before 1.6.0 this was handled by :func:`topRule`.

Cache misses
------------

For Rules related to the incoming query after a cache miss:

.. warning::
  While all selectors and actions are available, some actions will no longer be honored at
  this point. For example changing the backend pool will not trigger a second cache-lookup.
  Switching from a backend pool that has EDNS Client Subnet enabled to one that doesn't
  will result in the EDNS Client Subnet corresponding to the initial server pool to be
  added to the query.

.. function:: addCacheMissAction(DNSrule, action [, options])

.. warning::
  While almost all existing selectors and Response actions should be usable from
  the XFR response rules, it is strongly advised to only inspect the content of
  XFR response packets, and not modify them.
  Logging the content of response packets can be done via:

  - :func:`DnstapLogResponseAction`
  - :func:`LogResponseAction`
  - :func:`RemoteLogResponseAction`

Convenience Functions
---------------------

  * domain names: in which case it will behave as :func:`SuffixMatchNodeRule`

  Mixing both netmasks and domain names is not supported, and will result in domain names being ignored!

  ``makeRule("0.0.0.0/0")`` will for example match all IPv4 traffic, ``makeRule({"be","nl","lu"})`` will match all Benelux DNS traffic.

  :param string rule: A string, or list of strings, to convert to a rule.

.. function:: newRuleAction(rule, action[, options])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
