eBPF functions and objects
==========================

These are all the functions, objects and methods related to the :doc:`../advanced/ebpf`.

.. function:: addBPFFilterDynBlocks(addresses, dynbpf[[, seconds=10], msg])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0
    ``msg`` optional parameter added.

  This is the eBPF equivalent of :func:`addDynBlocks`, blocking a set of addresses for (optionally) a number of seconds, using an eBPF dynamic filter.
  The default number of seconds to block for is 10.

  :param addresses: set of Addresses as returned by an :ref:`exceed function <exceedfuncs>`
  :param DynBPFFilter dynbpf: The dynamic eBPF filter to use
  :param int seconds: The number of seconds this block to expire
  :param str msg: A message to display while inserting the block

.. function:: newBPFFilter(maxV4, maxV6, maxQNames) -> BPFFilter

  Return a new eBPF socket filter with a maximum of maxV4 IPv4, maxV6 IPv6 and maxQNames qname entries in the block table.

  :param int maxV4: Maximum number of IPv4 entries in this filter
  :param int maxV6: Maximum number of IPv6 entries in this filter
  :param int maxQNames: Maximum number of QName entries in this filter

.. function:: newDynBPFFilter(bpf) -> DynBPFFilter

  Return a new dynamic eBPF filter associated to a given BPF Filter.

  :param BPFFilter bpf: The underlying eBPF filter

.. function:: setDefaultBPFFilter(filter)

  When used at configuration time, the corresponding BPFFilter will be attached to every bind.

  :param BPFFilter filter: The filter to attach

.. function:: registerDynBPFFilter(dynbpf)

   Register a DynBPFFilter filter so that it appears in the web interface and the API.

  :param DynBPFFilter dynbpf: The dynamic eBPF filter to register

.. function:: unregisterDynBPFFilter(dynbpf)

   Remove a DynBPFFilter filter from the web interface and the API.

  :param DynBPFFilter dynbpf: The dynamic eBPF filter to unregister

.. class:: BPFFilter

  Represents an eBPF filter

  .. method:: BPFFilter:attachToAllBinds()

    Attach this filter to every bind already defined.
    This is the run-time equivalent of :func:`setDefaultBPFFilter`

  .. method:: BPFFilter:block(address)

    Block this address

    :param ComboAddress address: The address to block

  .. method:: BPFFilter:blockQName(name [, qtype=255])

    Block queries for this exact qname. An optional qtype can be used, defaults to 255.

    :param DNSName name: The name to block
    :param int qtype: QType to block

  .. method:: BPFFilter:getStats()

    Print the block tables.

  .. method:: BPFFilter:purgeExpired()

    Remove the expired ephemeral rules associated with this filter.

  .. method:: BPFFilter:unblock(address)

    Unblock this address.

    :param ComboAddress address: The address to unblock

  .. method:: BPFFilter:unblockQName(name [, qtype=255])

    Remove this qname from the block list.

    :param DNSName name: the name to unblock
    :param int qtype: The qtype to unblock

.. class:: DynBPFFilter

  Represents an dynamic eBPF filter, allowing the use of ephemeral rules to an existing eBPF filter.
