Configuration Reference
=======================

This page lists all configuration options for dnsdist.

.. note::

  When an IPv6 IP:PORT combination is needed, the bracketed syntax from :rfc:`RFC 3986 <3986#section-3.2.2>` should be used.
  e.g. "[2001:DB8:14::C0FF:FEE]:5300".

Functions and Types
-------------------

Within dnsdist several core object types exist:

* :class:`Server`: generated with :func:`newServer`, represents a downstream server
* :class:`ComboAddress`: represents an IP address and port
* :class:`DNSName`: represents a domain name
* :class:`Netmask`: represents a netmask
* :class:`NetmaskGroup`: represents a group of netmasks
* :class:`QPSLimiter`: implements a QPS-based filter
* :class:`SuffixMatchNode`: represents a group of domain suffixes for rapid testing of membership
* :class:`DNSHeader`: represents the header of a DNS packet, see :ref:`DNSHeader`
* :class:`ClientState`: sometimes also called Bind or Frontend, represents the addresses and ports dnsdist is listening on

The existence of most of these objects can mostly be ignored, unless you plan to write your own hooks and policies, but it helps to understand an expressions like:

.. code-block:: lua

  getServer(0).order=12         -- set order of server 0 to 12
  getServer(0):addPool("abuse") -- add this server to the abuse pool

The ``.`` means ``order`` is a data member, while the ``:`` means ``addPool`` is a member function.

Global configuration
--------------------

.. function:: addCapabilitiesToRetain(capabilities)

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Accept a Linux capability as a string, or a list of these, to retain after startup so that privileged operations can still be performed at runtime.
  Keeping ``CAP_BPF`` on kernel 5.8+ for example allows loading eBPF programs and altering eBPF maps at runtime even if the ``kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled`` sysctl is set.
  Note that this does not grant the capabilities to the process, doing so might be done by running it as root which we don't advise, or by adding capabilities via the systemd unit file, for example.
  Please also be aware that switching to a different user via ``--uid`` will still drop all capabilities.

.. function:: includeDirectory(path)

  Include configuration files from ``path``.

  :param str path: The directory to load configuration files from. Each file must end in ``.conf``.

.. function:: reloadAllCertificates()

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Reload all DNSCrypt and TLS certificates, along with their associated keys.

.. function:: setSyslogFacility(facility)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    ``facility`` can now be a string.

  Set the syslog logging facility to ``facility``.

  :param int or str facility: The new facility as a numeric value (raw value as defined in syslog.h), or as a case-insensitive string ("LOCAL0", or "daemon", for example). Defaults to LOG_DAEMON.

Listen Sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: addLocal(address[, options])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
    Removed ``doTCP`` from the options. A listen socket on TCP is always created.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    Added ``tcpListenQueueSize`` parameter.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    Added ``maxInFlight`` and ``maxConcurrentTCPConnections`` parameters.

  Add to the list of listen addresses. Note that for IPv6 link-local addresses, it might be necessary to specify the interface to use: ``fe80::1%eth0``. On recent Linux versions specifying the interface via the ``interface`` parameter should work as well.

  :param str address: The IP Address with an optional port to listen on.
                      The default port is 53.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with listen options.

  Options:

  * ``doTCP=true``: bool - Also bind on TCP on ``address``. Removed in 1.4.0.
  * ``reusePort=false``: bool - Set the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` socket option.
  * ``tcpFastOpenQueueSize=0``: int - Set the TCP Fast Open queue size, enabling TCP Fast Open when available and the value is larger than 0.
  * ``interface=""``: str - Set the network interface to use.
  * ``cpus={}``: table - Set the CPU affinity for this listener thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the pthread_setaffinity_np() function.
  * ``tcpListenQueueSize=SOMAXCONN``: int - Set the size of the listen queue. Default is ``SOMAXCONN``.
  * ``maxInFlight=0``: int - Maximum number of in-flight queries. The default is 0, which disables out-of-order processing.
  * ``maxConcurrentTCPConnections=0``: int - Maximum number of concurrent incoming TCP connections. The default is 0 which means unlimited.

  .. code-block:: lua

    addLocal('0.0.0.0:5300', { reusePort=true })

  This will bind to both UDP and TCP on port 5300 with SO_REUSEPORT enabled.

.. function:: addDOHLocal(address, [certFile(s) [, keyFile(s) [, urls [, options]]]])

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    ``internalPipeBufferSize``, ``sendCacheControlHeaders``, ``sessionTimeout``, ``trustForwardedForHeader`` options added.
    ``url`` now defaults to ``/dns-query`` instead of ``/``, and does exact matching instead of accepting sub-paths. Added ``tcpListenQueueSize`` parameter.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    ``enableRenegotiation``, ``exactPathMatching``, ``maxConcurrentTCPConnections`` and ``releaseBuffers`` options added.
    ``internalPipeBufferSize`` now defaults to 1048576 on Linux.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
     ``certFile`` now accepts a TLSCertificate object or a list of such objects (see :func:`newTLSCertificate`)
     ``additionalAddresses``, ``ignoreTLSConfigurationErrors`` and ``keepIncomingHeaders`` options added.

  Listen on the specified address and TCP port for incoming DNS over HTTPS connections, presenting the specified X.509 certificate.
  If no certificate (or key) files are specified, listen for incoming DNS over HTTP connections instead.

  :param str address: The IP Address with an optional port to listen on.
                      The default port is 443.
  :param str certFile(s): The path to a X.509 certificate file in PEM format, a list of paths to such files, or a TLSCertificate object.
  :param str keyFile(s): The path to the private key file corresponding to the certificate, or a list of paths to such files, whose order should match the certFile(s) ones. Ignored if ``certFile`` contains TLSCertificate objects.
  :param str-or-list urls: The path part of a URL, or a list of paths, to accept queries on. Any query with a path matching exactly one of these will be treated as a DoH query (sub-paths can be accepted by setting the ``exactPathMatching`` to false). The default is /dns-query.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with listen options.

  Options:

  * ``reusePort=false``: bool - Set the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` socket option.
  * ``tcpFastOpenQueueSize=0``: int - Set the TCP Fast Open queue size, enabling TCP Fast Open when available and the value is larger than 0.
  * ``interface=""``: str - Set the network interface to use.
  * ``cpus={}``: table - Set the CPU affinity for this listener thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the pthread_setaffinity_np() function.
  * ``idleTimeout=30``: int - Set the idle timeout, in seconds.
  * ``ciphers``: str - The TLS ciphers to use, in OpenSSL format. Ciphers for TLS 1.3 must be specified via ``ciphersTLS13``.
  * ``ciphersTLS13``: str - The TLS ciphers to use for TLS 1.3, in OpenSSL format.
  * ``serverTokens``: str - The content of the Server: HTTP header returned by dnsdist. The default is "h2o/dnsdist".
  * ``customResponseHeaders={}``: table - Set custom HTTP header(s) returned by dnsdist.
  * ``ocspResponses``: list - List of files containing OCSP responses, in the same order than the certificates and keys, that will be used to provide OCSP stapling responses.
  * ``minTLSVersion``: str - Minimum version of the TLS protocol to support. Possible values are 'tls1.0', 'tls1.1', 'tls1.2' and 'tls1.3'. Default is to require at least TLS 1.0.
  * ``numberOfTicketsKeys``: int - The maximum number of tickets keys to keep in memory at the same time. Only one key is marked as active and used to encrypt new tickets while the remaining ones can still be used to decrypt existing tickets after a rotation. Default to 5.
  * ``ticketKeyFile``: str - The path to a file from where TLS tickets keys should be loaded, to support :rfc:`5077`. These keys should be rotated often and never written to persistent storage to preserve forward secrecy. The default is to generate a random key. dnsdist supports several tickets keys to be able to decrypt existing sessions after the rotation. See :doc:`../advanced/tls-sessions-management` for more information.
  * ``ticketsKeysRotationDelay``: int - Set the delay before the TLS tickets key is rotated, in seconds. Default is 43200 (12h).
  * ``sessionTimeout``: int - Set the TLS session lifetime in seconds, this is used both for TLS ticket lifetime and for sessions kept in memory.
  * ``sessionTickets``: bool - Whether session resumption via session tickets is enabled. Default is true, meaning tickets are enabled.
  * ``numberOfStoredSessions``: int - The maximum number of sessions kept in memory at the same time. Default is 20480. Setting this value to 0 disables stored session entirely.
  * ``preferServerCiphers``: bool - Whether to prefer the order of ciphers set by the server instead of the one set by the client. Default is true, meaning that the order of the server is used. For OpenSSL >= 1.1.1, setting this option also enables the temporary re-prioritization of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher if the client prioritizes it.
  * ``keyLogFile``: str - Write the TLS keys in the specified file so that an external program can decrypt TLS exchanges, in the format described in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format. Note that this feature requires OpenSSL >= 1.1.1.
  * ``sendCacheControlHeaders``: bool - Whether to parse the response to find the lowest TTL and set a HTTP Cache-Control header accordingly. Default is true.
  * ``trustForwardedForHeader``: bool - Whether to parse any existing X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP query and use the right-most value as the client source address and port, for ACL checks, rules, logging and so on. Default is false.
  * ``tcpListenQueueSize=SOMAXCONN``: int - Set the size of the listen queue. Default is ``SOMAXCONN``.
  * ``internalPipeBufferSize=0``: int - Set the size in bytes of the internal buffer of the pipes used internally to pass queries and responses between threads. Requires support for ``F_SETPIPE_SZ`` which is present in Linux since 2.6.35. The actual size might be rounded up to a multiple of a page size. 0 means that the OS default size is used. The default value is 0, except on Linux where it is 1048576 since 1.6.0.
  * ``exactPathMatching=true``: bool - Whether to do exact path matching of the query path against the paths configured in ``urls`` (true, the default since 1.5.0) or to accepts sub-paths (false, and was the default before 1.5.0). This option was introduced in 1.6.0.
  * ``maxConcurrentTCPConnections=0``: int - Maximum number of concurrent incoming TCP connections. The default is 0 which means unlimited.
  * ``releaseBuffers=true``: bool - Whether OpenSSL should release its I/O buffers when a connection goes idle, saving roughly 35 kB of memory per connection.
  * ``enableRenegotiation=false``: bool - Whether secure TLS renegotiation should be enabled. Disabled by default since it increases the attack surface and is seldom used for DNS.
  * ``keepIncomingHeaders``: bool - Whether to retain the incoming headers in memory, to be able to use :func:`HTTPHeaderRule` or :meth:`DNSQuestion.getHTTPHeaders`. Default is false. Before 1.8.0 the headers were always kept in-memory.
  * ``additionalAddresses``: list - List of additional addresses (with port) to listen on. Using this option instead of creating a new frontend for each address avoids the creation of new thread and Frontend objects, reducing the memory usage. The drawback is that there will be a single set of metrics for all addresses.
  * ``ignoreTLSConfigurationErrors=false``: bool - Ignore TLS configuration errors (such as invalid certificate path) and just issue a warning instead of aborting the whole process

.. function:: addTLSLocal(address, certFile(s), keyFile(s) [, options])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
    ``ciphersTLS13``, ``minTLSVersion``, ``ocspResponses``, ``preferServerCiphers``, ``keyLogFile`` options added.
  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
    ``tlsAsyncMode`` option added.
  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
     ``certFile`` now accepts a TLSCertificate object or a list of such objects (see :func:`newTLSCertificate`).
     ``additionalAddresses``, ``ignoreTLSConfigurationErrors`` and ``ktls`` options added.

  Listen on the specified address and TCP port for incoming DNS over TLS connections, presenting the specified X.509 certificate.

  :param str address: The IP Address with an optional port to listen on.
                      The default port is 853.
  :param str certFile(s): The path to a X.509 certificate file in PEM format, a list of paths to such files, or a TLSCertificate object.
  :param str keyFile(s): The path to the private key file corresponding to the certificate, or a list of paths to such files, whose order should match the certFile(s) ones. Ignored if ``certFile`` contains TLSCertificate objects.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with listen options.

  Options:

  * ``reusePort=false``: bool - Set the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` socket option.
  * ``tcpFastOpenQueueSize=0``: int - Set the TCP Fast Open queue size, enabling TCP Fast Open when available and the value is larger than 0.
  * ``interface=""``: str - Set the network interface to use.
  * ``cpus={}``: table - Set the CPU affinity for this listener thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the pthread_setaffinity_np() function.
  * ``provider``: str - The TLS library to use between GnuTLS and OpenSSL, if they were available and enabled at compilation time. Default is to use OpenSSL when available.
  * ``ciphers``: str - The TLS ciphers to use. The exact format depends on the provider used. When the OpenSSL provider is used, ciphers for TLS 1.3 must be specified via ``ciphersTLS13``.
  * ``ciphersTLS13``: str - The ciphers to use for TLS 1.3, when the OpenSSL provider is used. When the GnuTLS provider is used, ``ciphers`` applies regardless of the TLS protocol and this setting is not used.
  * ``numberOfTicketsKeys``: int - The maximum number of tickets keys to keep in memory at the same time, if the provider supports it (GnuTLS doesn't, OpenSSL does). Only one key is marked as active and used to encrypt new tickets while the remaining ones can still be used to decrypt existing tickets after a rotation. Default to 5.
  * ``ticketKeyFile``: str - The path to a file from where TLS tickets keys should be loaded, to support :rfc:`5077`. These keys should be rotated often and never written to persistent storage to preserve forward secrecy. The default is to generate a random key. The OpenSSL provider supports several tickets keys to be able to decrypt existing sessions after the rotation, while the GnuTLS provider only supports one key. See :doc:`../advanced/tls-sessions-management` for more information.
  * ``ticketsKeysRotationDelay``: int - Set the delay before the TLS tickets key is rotated, in seconds. Default is 43200 (12h).
  * ``sessionTimeout``: int - Set the TLS session lifetime in seconds, this is used both for TLS ticket lifetime and for sessions kept in memory.
  * ``sessionTickets``: bool - Whether session resumption via session tickets is enabled. Default is true, meaning tickets are enabled.
  * ``numberOfStoredSessions``: int - The maximum number of sessions kept in memory at the same time. At this time this is only supported by the OpenSSL provider, as stored sessions are not supported with the GnuTLS one. Default is 20480. Setting this value to 0 disables stored session entirely.
  * ``ocspResponses``: list - List of files containing OCSP responses, in the same order than the certificates and keys, that will be used to provide OCSP stapling responses.
  * ``minTLSVersion``: str - Minimum version of the TLS protocol to support. Possible values are 'tls1.0', 'tls1.1', 'tls1.2' and 'tls1.3'. Default is to require at least TLS 1.0. Note that this value is ignored when the GnuTLS provider is in use, and the ``ciphers`` option should be set accordingly instead. For example, 'NORMAL:!VERS-TLS1.0:!VERS-TLS1.1' will disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
  * ``preferServerCiphers``: bool - Whether to prefer the order of ciphers set by the server instead of the one set by the client. Default is true, meaning that the order of the server is used. For OpenSSL >= 1.1.1, setting this option also enables the temporary re-prioritization of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher if the client prioritizes it.
  * ``keyLogFile``: str - Write the TLS keys in the specified file so that an external program can decrypt TLS exchanges, in the format described in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format. Note that this feature requires OpenSSL >= 1.1.1.

  * ``maxConcurrentTCPConnections=0``: int - Maximum number of concurrent incoming TCP connections. The default is 0 which means unlimited.
  * ``releaseBuffers=true``: bool - Whether OpenSSL should release its I/O buffers when a connection goes idle, saving roughly 35 kB of memory per connection.
  * ``enableRenegotiation=false``: bool - Whether secure TLS renegotiation should be enabled (OpenSSL only, the GnuTLS provider does not support it). Disabled by default since it increases the attack surface and is seldom used for DNS.
  * ``tlsAsyncMode=false``: bool - Whether to enable experimental asynchronous TLS I/O operations if OpenSSL is used as the TLS implementation and an asynchronous capable SSL engine (or provider) is loaded. See also :func:`loadTLSEngine` or :func:`loadTLSProvider` to load the engine (or provider).
  * ``additionalAddresses``: list - List of additional addresses (with port) to listen on. Using this option instead of creating a new frontend for each address avoids the creation of new thread and Frontend objects, reducing the memory usage. The drawback is that there will be a single set of metrics for all addresses.
  * ``ignoreTLSConfigurationErrors=false``: bool - Ignore TLS configuration errors (such as invalid certificate path) and just issue a warning instead of aborting the whole process
  * ``ktls=false``: bool - Whether to enable the experimental kernel TLS support on Linux, if both the kernel and the OpenSSL library support it. Default is false.

.. function:: setLocal(address[, options])

  Remove the list of listen addresses and add a new one.

  :param str address: The IP Address with an optional port to listen on.
                      The default port is 53.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with listen options.

  The options that can be set are the same as :func:`addLocal`.

Control Socket, Console and Webserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: addConsoleACL(netmask)

  Add a netmask to the existing console ACL, allowing remote clients to connect to the console. Please make sure that encryption
  has been enabled with :func:`setKey` before doing so. The default is to only allow 127.0.0.1/8 and ::1/128.

  :param str netmask: A CIDR netmask, e.g. ``"192.0.2.0/24"``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

.. function:: clearConsoleHistory()

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Clear the internal (in-memory) buffers of console commands. These buffers are used to provide the :func:`delta` command and
  console completion and history, and can end up being quite large when a lot of commands are issued via the console, consuming
  a noticeable amount of memory.

.. function:: controlSocket(address)

  Bind to ``addr`` and listen for a connection for the console. Since 1.3.0 only connections from local users are allowed
  by default, :func:`addConsoleACL` and :func:`setConsoleACL` can be used to enable remote connections. Please make sure
  that encryption has been enabled with :func:`setKey` before doing so. Enabling encryption is also strongly advised for
  local connections, since not enabling it allows any local user to connect to the console.

  :param str address: An IP address with optional port. By default, the port is 5199.

.. function:: delta()

  Issuing `delta` on the console will print the changes to the configuration that have been made since startup.

.. function:: inClientStartup()

  Returns true while the console client is parsing the configuration.

.. function:: inConfigCheck()

  .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

  Returns true while the configuration is being checked, ie when run with ``--check-config``.

.. function:: makeKey()

  Generate and print an encryption key.

.. function:: setConsoleConnectionsLogging(enabled)

  Whether to log the opening and closing of console connections.

  :param bool enabled: Default to true.

.. function:: setConsoleMaximumConcurrentConnections(max)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Set the maximum number of concurrent console connections.

  :param int max: The maximum number of concurrent console connections, or 0 which means an unlimited number. Defaults to 100

.. function:: setKey(key)

  Use ``key`` as shared secret between the client and the server

  :param str key: An encoded key, as generated by :func:`makeKey`

.. function:: setConsoleACL(netmasks)

  Remove the existing console ACL and add the netmasks from the table, allowing remote clients to connect to the console. Please make sure that encryption
  has been enabled with :func:`setKey` before doing so.

  :param {str} netmasks: A table of CIDR netmask, e.g. ``{"192.0.2.0/24", "2001:DB8:14::/56"}``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

.. function:: showConsoleACL()

  Print a list of all netmasks allowed to connect to the console.

.. function:: testCrypto()

  Test the crypto code, will report errors when something is not ok.

.. function:: setConsoleOutputMaxMsgSize(size)

  Set the maximum size in bytes of a single console message, default set to 10 MB.

  :param int size: The new maximum size.

Webserver configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: hashPassword(password [, workFactor])

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Hash the supplied password using a random salt, and returns a string that can be used with :func:`setWebserverConfig`.

  :param string - password: The password to hash
  :param int - workFactor: The work factor to use for the hash function (currently scrypt), as a power of two. Default is 1024.

.. function:: webserver(listen_address [, password[, apikey[, customHeaders[, acl]]]])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    ``acl`` optional parameter added.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    The ``password`` parameter is now optional.
    The use of optional parameters is now deprecated. Please use :func:`setWebserverConfig` instead.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
    The ``password``, ``apikey``, ``customHeaders`` and ``acl`` parameters is no longer supported.
    Please use :func:`setWebserverConfig` instead.

  Launch the :doc:`../guides/webserver` with statistics and the API. Note that the parameters are global, so the parameter from the last ``webserver`` will override any existing ones. For this reason :func:`setWebserverConfig` should be used instead of specifying optional parameters here.

  :param str listen_address: The IP address and Port to listen on
  :param str password: The password required to access the webserver
  :param str apikey: The key required to access the API
  :param {[str]=str,...} customHeaders: Allows setting custom headers and removing the defaults
  :param str acl: List of netmasks, as a string, that are allowed to open a connection to the web server. Defaults to "127.0.0.1, ::1". It accepts the same syntax that :func:`NetmaskGroup:addMask` does

.. function:: setAPIWritable(allow [,dir])

  Allow modifications via the API.
  Optionally saving these changes to disk.
  Modifications done via the API will not be written to the configuration by default and will not persist after a reload

    The optional ``hashPlaintextCredentials`` parameter has been added.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
    ``apiRequiresAuthentication``, ``dashboardRequiresAuthentication`` optional parameters added.

  Setup webserver configuration. See :func:`webserver`.

  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with webserver options.

  Options:

  * ``password=newPassword``: string - Set the password used to access the internal webserver. Since 1.7.0 the password should be hashed and salted via the :func:`hashPassword` command.
  * ``apiKey=newKey``: string - Changes the API Key (set to an empty string do disable it). Since 1.7.0 the key should be hashed and salted via the :func:`hashPassword` command.
  * ``customHeaders={[str]=str,...}``: map of string - Allows setting custom headers and removing the defaults.
  * ``acl=newACL``: string - List of IP addresses, as a string, that are allowed to open a connection to the web server. Defaults to "127.0.0.1, ::1".
  * ``apiRequiresAuthentication``: bool - Whether access to the API (/api endpoints) require a valid API key. Defaults to true.
  * ``dashboardRequiresAuthentication``: bool - Whether access to the internal dashboard requires a valid password. Defaults to true.
  * ``statsRequireAuthentication``: bool - Whether access to the statistics (/metrics and /jsonstat endpoints) require a valid password or API key. Defaults to true.
  * ``maxConcurrentConnections``: int - The maximum number of concurrent web connections, or 0 which means an unlimited number. Defaults to 100.
  * ``hashPlaintextCredentials``: bool - Whether passwords and API keys provided in plaintext should be hashed during startup, to prevent the plaintext versions from staying in memory. Doing so increases significantly the cost of verifying credentials. Defaults to false.

.. function:: registerWebHandler(path, handler)

  .. versionadded: 1.6.0

  Register a function named ``handler`` that will be called for every query sent to the exact ``path`` path. The function will receive a :class:`WebRequest` object
  and a :class:`WebResponse` object, representing respectively the HTTP request received and the HTTP response to send.
  For example a handler registered for '/foo' will receive these queries:

  - ``GET /foo``
  - ``POST /foo``
  - ``GET /foo?param=1``

  But not queries for /foobar or /foo/bar.

  A sample handler function could be:

  .. code-block:: lua

    function customHTTPHandler(req, resp)
      local get = req.getvars
      local headers = req.headers

      if req.path ~= '/foo' or req.version ~= 11 or req.method ~= 'GET' or get['param'] ~= '42' or headers['custom'] ~= 'foobar' then
        resp.status = 500
        return
      end

      resp.status = 200
      resp.body = 'It works!'
      resp.headers = { ['Foo']='Bar'}
    end

    registerWebHandler('/foo', customHTTPHandler)

  :param str path: Path to register the handler for.
  :param function handler: The Lua function to register.

.. function:: showWebserverConfig()

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Show the current webserver configuration. See :func:`webserver`.


Access Control Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: addACL(netmask)

  Add a netmask to the existing ACL controlling which clients can send UDP, TCP, DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS queries. See :ref:`ACL` for more information.

  :param str netmask: A CIDR netmask, e.g. ``"192.0.2.0/24"``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

.. function:: rmACL(netmask)

  Remove a network from the existing ACL controlling which clients can send UDP, TCP, DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS queries. See :ref:`ACL` for more information.
  This function only removes previously added entries, it does not remove subnets of entries.

  :param str netmask: A CIDR netmask, e.g. ``"192.0.2.0/24"``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

  .. code-block:: lua

    addACL("192.0.2.0/24") -- for example add subnet to the ACL
    rmACL("192.0.2.10")    -- does NOT work, the ACL is unchanged
    rmACL("192.0.2.0/24")  -- does work, the exact match is removed from the ACL

.. function:: setACL(netmasks)

  Remove the existing ACL and add the netmasks from the table of those allowed to send UDP, TCP, DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS queries. See :ref:`ACL` for more information.

  :param {str} netmasks: A table of CIDR netmask, e.g. ``{"192.0.2.0/24", "2001:DB8:14::/56"}``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

.. function:: setACLFromFile(fname)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Reset the ACL to the list of netmasks from the given file. See :ref:`ACL` for more information.

  :param str fname: The path to a file containing a list of netmasks. Empty lines or lines starting with "#" are ignored.

.. function:: setProxyProtocolACL(netmasks)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Set the list of netmasks from which a Proxy Protocol header will be required, over UDP, TCP and DNS over TLS. The default is empty. Note that a proxy protocol payload will be required from these clients, regular DNS queries will no longer be accepted if they are not preceded by a proxy protocol payload. Be also aware that, if :func:`setProxyProtocolApplyACLToProxiedClients` is set (default is false), the general ACL will be applied to the source IP address as seen by dnsdist first, but also to the source IP address provided in the Proxy Protocol header.

  :param {str} netmasks: A table of CIDR netmask, e.g. ``{"192.0.2.0/24", "2001:DB8:14::/56"}``. Without a subnetmask, only the specific address is allowed.

.. function:: setProxyProtocolApplyACLToProxiedClients(apply)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Whether the general ACL should be applied to the source IP address provided in the Proxy Protocol header, in addition to being applied to the source IP address as seen by dnsdist first.

  :param bool apply: Whether it should be applied or not (default is false).

.. function:: showACL()

  Print a list of all netmasks allowed to send queries over UDP, TCP, DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS. See :ref:`ACL` for more information.

EDNS Client Subnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: setECSOverride(bool)

  When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer` is set and dnsdist adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, override an existing option already present in the query, if any.
  Note that it's not recommended to enable ``setECSOverride`` in front of an authoritative server responding with EDNS Client Subnet information as mismatching data (ECS scopes) can confuse clients and lead to SERVFAIL responses on downstream nameservers.

  :param bool: Whether to override an existing EDNS Client Subnet option present in the query. Defaults to false

.. function:: setECSSourcePrefixV4(prefix)

  When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer` is set and dnsdist adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, truncate the requestors IPv4 address to ``prefix`` bits

  :param int prefix: The prefix length

.. function:: setECSSourcePrefixV6(prefix)

  When ``useClientSubnet`` in :func:`newServer` is set and dnsdist adds an EDNS Client Subnet Client option to the query, truncate the requestor's IPv6 address to  bits

  :param int prefix: The prefix length

Ringbuffers
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: setRingBuffersLockRetries(num)

  .. deprecated:: 1.8.0
    Deprecated in 1.8.0 in favor of :func:`setRingBuffersOptions` which provides more options.

  Set the number of shards to attempt to lock without blocking before giving up and simply blocking while waiting for the next shard to be available

  :param int num: The maximum number of attempts. Defaults to 5 if there is more than one shard, 0 otherwise.

.. function:: setRingBuffersOptions(options)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Set the rings buffers configuration

  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``lockRetries``: int - Set the number of shards to attempt to lock without blocking before giving up and simply blocking while waiting for the next shard to be available. Default to 5 if there is more than one shard, 0 otherwise
  * ``recordQueries``: boolean - Whether to record queries in the ring buffers. Default is true. Note that :func:`grepq`, several top* commands (:func:`topClients`, :func:`topQueries`, ...) and the :doc:`Dynamic Blocks <../guides/dynblocks>` require this to be enabled.
  * ``recordResponses``: boolean - Whether to record responses in the ring buffers. Default is true. Note that :func:`grepq`, several top* commands (:func:`topResponses`, :func:`topSlow`, ...) and the :doc:`Dynamic Blocks <../guides/dynblocks>` require this to be enabled.

.. function:: setRingBuffersSize(num [, numberOfShards])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    ``numberOfShards`` defaults to 10.

  Set the capacity of the ringbuffers used for live traffic inspection to ``num``, and the number of shards to ``numberOfShards`` if specified.
  Increasing the number of entries comes at both a memory cost (around 250 MB for 1 million entries) and a CPU processing cost, so we strongly advise not going over 1 million entries.

  :param int num: The maximum amount of queries to keep in the ringbuffer. Defaults to 10000
  :param int numberOfShards: the number of shards to use to limit lock contention. Default is 10, used to be 1 before 1.6.0

Note that for backends which are multithreaded, this setting will have an effect on the number of cores that will be used to process traffic from dnsdist. For example you may want to set 'sockets' to a number somewhat higher than the number of worker threads configured in the backend, particularly if the Linux kernel is being used to distribute traffic to multiple threads listening on the same socket (via `reuseport`). See also :func:`setRandomizedOutgoingSockets`.

It should only be enabled if the backend does support out-of-order processing. As of 1.6.0, out-of-order processing needs to be enabled on the frontend as well, via :func:`addLocal` and/or :func:`addTLSLocal`. Note that out-of-order is always enabled on DoH frontends.

Default is 'auto'. See :ref:`Healthcheck` for a more detailed explanation.
      lazyHealthCheckFailedInterval=NUM,         -- The interval, in seconds, between health-check queries in 'lazy' mode. Note that when ``lazyHealthCheckUseExponentialBackOff`` is set to true, the interval doubles between every queries.

      lazyHealthCheckUseExponentialBackOff=BOOL, -- Whether the 'lazy' health-check should use an exponential back-off instead of a fixed value, between health-check probes. The default is false which means that after a backend has been moved to the 'down' state health-check probes are sent every ``lazyHealthCheckFailedInterval`` seconds. When set to true, the delay between each probe starts at ``lazyHealthCheckFailedInterval`` seconds and double between every probe, capped at ``lazyHealthCheckMaxBackOff`` seconds.

  This represents the pool where zero or more servers are part of.

  .. method:: ServerPool:getCache() -> PacketCache

    Returns the :class:`PacketCache` for this pool or nil.

  .. method:: ServerPool:getECS()

    when all servers from this pool are down. For more information see :meth:`ServerPool:setECS`.

  .. method:: ServerPool:setCache(cache)

    Adds ``cache`` as the pool's cache.

    :param PacketCache cache: The new cache to add to the pool

  .. method:: ServerPool:unsetCache()

    Removes the cache from this pool.

  .. method:: ServerPool:setECS()

    Set to true if dnsdist should add EDNS Client Subnet information to the query before looking up into the cache,
    when all servers from this pool are down. If at least one server is up, the preference of the
    selected server is used, this parameter is only useful if all the backends in this pool are down
    and have EDNS Client Subnet enabled, since the queries in the cache will have been inserted with
    ECS information. Default is false.

PacketCache
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Pool can have a packet cache to answer queries directly instead of going to the backend.
See :doc:`../guides/cache` for a how to.

.. function:: newPacketCache(maxEntries[, maxTTL=86400[, minTTL=0[, temporaryFailureTTL=60[, staleTTL=60[, dontAge=false[, numberOfShards=1[, deferrableInsertLock=true[, maxNegativeTTL=3600[, parseECS=false]]]]]]]) -> PacketCache

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.0

  Creates a new :class:`PacketCache` with the settings specified.

  :param int maxEntries: The maximum number of entries in this cache
  :param int maxTTL: Cap the TTL for records to his number
  :param int minTTL: Don't cache entries with a TTL lower than this
  :param int temporaryFailureTTL: On a SERVFAIL or REFUSED from the backend, cache for this amount of seconds
  :param int staleTTL: When the backend servers are not reachable, and global configuration ``setStaleCacheEntriesTTL`` is set appropriately, TTL that will be used when a stale cache entry is returned
  :param bool dontAge: Don't reduce TTLs when serving from the cache. Use this when :program:`dnsdist` fronts a cluster of authoritative servers
  :param int numberOfShards: Number of shards to divide the cache into, to reduce lock contention
  :param bool deferrableInsertLock: Whether the cache should give up insertion if the lock is held by another thread, or simply wait to get the lock
  :param int maxNegativeTTL: Cache a NXDomain or NoData answer from the backend for at most this amount of seconds, even if the TTL of the SOA record is higher
  :param bool parseECS: Whether any EDNS Client Subnet option present in the query should be extracted and stored to be able to detect hash collisions involving queries with the same qname, qtype and qclass but a different incoming ECS value. Enabling this option adds a parsing cost and only makes sense if at least one backend might send different responses based on the ECS value, so it's disabled by default

.. function:: newPacketCache(maxEntries, [options]) -> PacketCache

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    ``cookieHashing`` parameter added.
    ``numberOfShards`` now defaults to 20.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.7.0
    ``skipOptions`` parameter added.

  Creates a new :class:`PacketCache` with the settings specified.

  :param int maxEntries: The maximum number of entries in this cache

  Options:

  * ``deferrableInsertLock=true``: bool - Whether the cache should give up insertion if the lock is held by another thread, or simply wait to get the lock.
  * ``dontAge=false``: bool - Don't reduce TTLs when serving from the cache. Use this when :program:`dnsdist` fronts a cluster of authoritative servers.
  * ``keepStaleData=false``: bool - Whether to suspend the removal of expired entries from the cache when there is no backend available in at least one of the pools using this cache.
  * ``maxNegativeTTL=3600``: int - Cache a NXDomain or NoData answer from the backend for at most this amount of seconds, even if the TTL of the SOA record is higher.
  * ``maxTTL=86400``: int - Cap the TTL for records to his number.
  * ``minTTL=0``: int - Don't cache entries with a TTL lower than this.
  * ``numberOfShards=20``: int - Number of shards to divide the cache into, to reduce lock contention. Used to be 1 (no shards) before 1.6.0, and is now 20.
  * ``parseECS=false``: bool - Whether any EDNS Client Subnet option present in the query should be extracted and stored to be able to detect hash collisions involving queries with the same qname, qtype and qclass but a different incoming ECS value. Enabling this option adds a parsing cost and only makes sense if at least one backend might send different responses based on the ECS value, so it's disabled by default. Enabling this option is required for the 'zero scope' option to work
  * ``staleTTL=60``: int - When the backend servers are not reachable, and global configuration ``setStaleCacheEntriesTTL`` is set appropriately, TTL that will be used when a stale cache entry is returned.
  * ``temporaryFailureTTL=60``: int - On a SERVFAIL or REFUSED from the backend, cache for this amount of seconds..
  * ``cookieHashing=false``: bool - If true, EDNS Cookie values will be hashed, resulting in separate entries for different cookies in the packet cache. This is required if the backend is sending answers with EDNS Cookies, otherwise a client might receive an answer with the wrong cookie.
  * ``skipOptions={}``: Extra list of EDNS option codes to skip when hashing the packet (if ``cookieHashing`` above is false, EDNS cookie option number will be added to this list internally).

  :param int seconds: The number of seconds this block to expire
  :param int action: The action to take when the dynamic block matches, see :ref:`DNSAction <DNSAction>`. (default to DNSAction.None, meaning the one set with :func:`setDynBlocksAction` is used)

  Please see the documentation for :func:`setDynBlocksAction` to confirm which actions are supported by the action paramater.

.. function:: clearDynBlocks()

  frees up the memory they use.
  Setting this value to 0 disable the purging mechanism, so entries will remain in the tree.

  :param int sec: The interval between two runs of the cleaning algorithm, in seconds. Default is 60 (1 minute), 0 means disabled.

.. _exceedfuncs:

DynBlockRulesGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using several `exceed*()` lines, dnsdist 1.3.0 introduced a new `DynBlockRulesGroup` object
which can be used to group dynamic block rules.

See :doc:`../guides/dynblocks` for more information about the case where using a `DynBlockRulesGroup` might be
faster than the existing rules.

.. function:: dynBlockRulesGroup() -> DynBlockRulesGroup

  Creates a new :class:`DynBlockRulesGroup` object.

.. class:: DynBlockRulesGroup

  Represents a group of dynamic block rules.

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:setMasks(v4, v6, port)

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Set the number of bits to keep in the IP address when inserting a block. The default is 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6, meaning
    that only the exact address is blocked, but in some scenarios it might make sense to block a whole /64 IPv6 range instead of a
    single address, for example.
    It is also possible to take the IPv4 UDP and TCP ports into account, for CGNAT deployments, by setting the number of bits of the port
    to consider. For example passing 2 as the last parameter, which only makes sense if the previous parameters are respectively 32
    and 128, will split a given IP address into four port ranges: 0-16383, 16384-32767, 32768-49151 and 49152-65535.

    :param int v4: Number of bits to keep for IPv4 addresses. Default is 32
    :param int v6: Number of bits to keep for IPv6 addresses. Default is 128
    :param int port: Number of bits of port to consider over IPv4. Default is 0 meaning that the port is not taken into account

    addDynBlocks(exceedRespByterate(rate, seconds), reason, blockingTime, action)
    ```

    :param int rate: Number of bytes per second to exceed
    :param int seconds: Number of seconds the rate has been exceeded
    :param string reason: The message to show next to the blocks
    :param int blockingTime: The number of seconds this block to expire
    :param int action: The action to take when the dynamic block matches, see :ref:`DNSAction <DNSAction>`. (default to the one set with :func:`setDynBlocksAction`)
    :param int warningRate: If set to a non-zero value, the rate above which a warning message will be issued and a no-op block inserted

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRule(seconds, reason, blockingTime, action , visitor)

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    .. versionchanged:: 1.7.0
      This visitor function can now optionally return an additional string which will be set as the ``reason`` for the dynamic block.

    Set a Lua visitor function that will be called for each label of every domain seen in queries and responses. The function receives a :class:`StatNode` object representing the stats of the parent, a :class:`StatNodeStats` one with the stats of the current label and a second :class:`StatNodeStats` with the stats of the current node plus all its children.
    Note that this function will not be called if a FFI version has been set using :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRuleFFI`
    If the function returns true, the current label will be blocked according to the `seconds`, `reason`, `blockingTime` and `action` parameters. Since 1.7.0, the function can return an additional string, in addition to the boolean, which will be set as the ``reason`` for the dynamic block.
    Selected domains can be excluded from this processing using the :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeDomains` method.

    This replaces the existing :func:`addDynBlockSMT` function.

    :param int seconds: Number of seconds the rate has been exceeded
    :param string reason: The message to show next to the blocks
    :param int blockingTime: The number of seconds this block to expire
    :param int action: The action to take when the dynamic block matches, see :ref:`DNSAction <DNSAction>`. (default to the one set with :func:`setDynBlocksAction`)
    :param function visitor: The Lua function to call.

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRuleFFI(seconds, reason, blockingTime, action , visitor)

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Set a Lua FFI visitor function that will be called for each label of every domain seen in queries and responses. The function receives a `dnsdist_ffi_stat_node_t` object containing the stats of the parent, a second one with the stats of the current label and one with the stats of the current node plus all its children.
    If the function returns true, the current label will be blocked according to the `seconds`, `reason`, `blockingTime` and `action` parameters.
    Selected domains can be excluded from this processing using the :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeDomains` method.

    :param int seconds: Number of seconds the rate has been exceeded
    :param string reason: The message to show next to the blocks
    :param int blockingTime: The number of seconds this block to expire
    :param int action: The action to take when the dynamic block matches, see :ref:`DNSAction <DNSAction>`. (default to the one set with :func:`setDynBlocksAction`)
    :param function visitor: The Lua FFI function to call.

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:apply()

    Walk the in-memory query and response ring buffers and apply the configured rate-limiting rules, adding dynamic blocks when the limits have been exceeded.

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:setQuiet(quiet)

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Set whether newly blocked clients or domains should be logged.

    :param bool quiet: True means that insertions will not be logged, false that they will. Default is false.

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeDomains(domains)

    .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

    Exclude this domain, or list of domains, meaning that no dynamic block will ever be inserted for this domain via :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRule` or :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRuleFFI`. Default to empty, meaning rules are applied to all domains.

    :param str domain: A domain, or list of domains, as strings, like for example "powerdns.com"

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeRange(netmasks)

    .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
      This method now accepts a :class:`NetmaskGroup` object.

    Exclude this range, or list of ranges, meaning that no dynamic block will ever be inserted for clients in that range. Default to empty, meaning rules are applied to all ranges. When used in combination with :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:includeRange`, the more specific entry wins.

    :param list netmasks: A :class:`NetmaskGroup` object, or a netmask or list of netmasks as strings, like for example "192.0.2.1/24"

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:includeRange(netmasks)

    .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
      This method now accepts a :class:`NetmaskGroup` object.

    Include this range, or list of ranges, meaning that rules will be applied to this range. When used in combination with :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeRange`, the more specific entry wins.

    :param list netmasks: A :class:`NetmaskGroup` object, or a netmask or list of netmasks as strings, like for example "192.0.2.1/24"

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:toString()

  Represent a given node, for the visitor functions used with :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRule` and :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:setSuffixMatchRuleFFI`.

  .. attribute:: StatNode.fullname

    The complete name of that node, ie 'www.powerdns.com.'.

  .. attribute:: StatNode.labelsCount

    The number of labels in that node, for example 3 for 'www.powerdns.com.'.

SuffixMatchNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SuffixMatchNode can be used to quickly check whether a given name belongs to a set or not. This is achieved
using an efficient tree structure based on DNS labels, making lookups cheap.
Be careful that Suffix Node matching will match for any sub-domain, regardless of the depth, under the name added to the set. For example,
if 'example.com.' is added to the set, 'www.example.com.' and 'sub.www.example.com.' will match as well.
If you are looking for exact name matching, your might want to consider using a :class:`DNSNameSet` instead.

.. function:: newSuffixMatchNode()

  Creates a new :class:`SuffixMatchNode`.

.. class:: SuffixMatchNode

  Represent a set of DNS suffixes for quick matching.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:add(name)

    .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
      This method now accepts strings, lists of DNSNames and lists of strings.

    Add a suffix to the current set.

    :param DNSName name: The suffix to add to the set.
    :param string name: The suffix to add to the set.
    :param table name: The suffixes to add to the set. Elements of the table should be of the same type, either DNSName or string.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:check(name) -> bool

    Return true if the given name is a sub-domain of one of those in the set, and false otherwise.

    :param DNSName name: The name to test against the set.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:getBestMatch(name) -> DNSName

    .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

    Returns the best match for the supplied name, or nil if there was no match.

    :param DNSName name: The name to look up.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:remove(name)

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

    Remove a suffix from the current set.

    :param DNSName name: The suffix to remove from the set.
    :param string name: The suffix to remove from the set.
    :param table name: The suffixes to remove from the set. Elements of the table should be of the same type, either DNSName or string.

Outgoing TLS tickets cache management
-------------------------------------

Since 1.7, dnsdist supports securing the connection toward backends using DNS over TLS. For these connections, it keeps a cache of TLS tickets to be able to resume a TLS session quickly. By default that cache contains up to 20 TLS tickets per-backend, is cleaned up every 60s, and TLS tickets expire if they have not been used after 600 seconds.
These values can be set at configuration time via:

.. function:: setOutgoingTLSSessionsCacheMaxTicketsPerBackend(num)

  .. versionadded: 1.7.0

  Set the maximum number of TLS tickets to keep, per-backend, to be able to quickly resume outgoing TLS connections to a backend. Keeping more tickets might provide a better TLS session resumption rate if there is a sudden peak of outgoing connections, at the cost of using a bit more memory.

  :param int num: The number of TLS tickets to keep, per-backend. The default is 20.

.. function:: setOutgoingTLSSessionsCacheCleanupDelay(delay)

  .. versionadded: 1.7.0

  Set the number of seconds between two scans of the TLS sessions cache, removing expired tickets and freeing up memory. Decreasing that value will lead to more scans, freeing up memory more quickly but using a bit more CPU doing so.

  :param int delay: The number of seconds between two scans of the cache. The default is 60.

.. function:: setOutgoingTLSSessionsCacheMaxTicketValidity(validity)

  .. versionadded: 1.7.0

  Set the number of seconds that a given TLS ticket can be kept inactive in the TLS sessions cache. After that delay the ticket will be removed during the next cleanup of the cache. Increasing that value might increase the TLS resumption rate if new connections are not often created, but it might also lead to trying to reuse a ticket that the server will consider too old and refuse.

  :param int validity: The number of seconds a ticket is considered valid. The default is 600, which matches the default lifetime of TLS tickets set by OpenSSL.

Other functions
---------------

.. function:: getCurrentTime -> timespec

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Return the current time, in whole seconds and nanoseconds since epoch.

  :returns: A timespec object, see :ref:`timespec`

.. function:: getResolvers(path)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  This function can be used to get a Lua table of name servers from a file in the resolv.conf format.

  :param str path: The path to the file, usually /etc/resolv.conf

.. function:: maintenance()

  If this function exists, it is called every second to do regular tasks.
  This can be used for e.g. :doc:`Dynamic Blocks <../guides/dynblocks>`.

.. function:: threadmessage(cmd, dict)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  This function, if it exists, is called when a separate thread (made with :func:`newThread`) calls :func:`submitToMainThread`.

.. function:: newThread(code)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Spawns a separate thread running the supplied code.
  Code is supplied as a string, not as a function object.
  Note that this function does nothing in 'client' or 'config-check' modes.

.. function:: submitToMainThread(cmd, dict)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Must be called from a separate thread (made with :func:`newThread`), submits data to the main thread by calling :func:`threadmessage` in it.
  If no ``threadmessage`` receiver is present in the main thread, ``submitToMainThread`` logs an error but returns normally.

  The ``cmd`` argument is a string.
  The ``dict`` argument is a Lua table.

.. function:: setAllowEmptyResponse()

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Set to true (defaults to false) to allow empty responses (qdcount=0) with a NoError or NXDomain rcode (default) from backends. dnsdist drops these responses by default because it can't match them against the initial query since they don't contain the qname, qtype and qclass, and therefore the risk of collision is much higher than with regular responses.

.. function:: setDropEmptyQueries(drop)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Set to true (defaults to false) to drop empty queries (qdcount=0) right away, instead of answering with a NotImp rcode. dnsdist used to drop these queries by default because most rules and existing Lua code expects a query to have a qname, qtype and qclass. However :rfc:`7873` uses these queries to request a server cookie, and :rfc:`8906` as a conformance test, so answering these queries with NotImp is much better than not answering at all.

  :param bool drop: Whether to drop these queries (defaults to false)

.. function:: setProxyProtocolMaximumPayloadSize(size)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Set the maximum size of a Proxy Protocol payload that dnsdist is willing to accept, in bytes. The default is 512, which is more than enough except for very large TLV data. This setting can't be set to a value lower than 16 since it would deny of Proxy Protocol headers.

  :param int size: The maximum size in bytes (default is 512)

.. function:: setTCPFastOpenKey(key)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Set the supplied ``TCP Fast Open`` key on all frontends. This can for example be used to allow all dnsdist instances in an anycast cluster to use the same ``TCP Fast Open`` key, reducing round-trips.

  :param string key: The format of the key can be found in ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key``

.. function:: makeIPCipherKey(password) -> string

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Hashes the password to generate a 16-byte key that can be used to pseudonymize IP addresses with IP cipher.

.. function:: generateOCSPResponse(pathToServerCertificate, pathToCACertificate, pathToCAPrivateKey, outputFile, numberOfDaysOfValidity, numberOfMinutesOfValidity)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  When a local PKI is used to issue the certificate, or for testing purposes, :func:`generateOCSPResponse` can be used to generate an OCSP response file for a certificate, using the certificate and private key of the certification authority that signed that certificate.
  The resulting file can be directly used with the :func:`addDOHLocal` or the :func:`addTLSLocal` functions.

  :param string pathToServerCertificate: Path to a file containing the certificate used by the server.
  :param string pathToCACertificate: Path to a file containing the certificate of the certification authority that was used to sign the server certificate.
  :param string pathToCAPrivateKey: Path to a file containing the private key corresponding to the certification authority certificate.
  :param string outputFile: Path to a file where the resulting OCSP response will be written to.
  :param int numberOfDaysOfValidity: Number of days this OCSP response should be valid.
  :param int numberOfMinutesOfValidity: Number of minutes this OCSP response should be valid, in addition to the number of days.

.. function:: getRingEntries()

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Return a list of all the entries, queries and responses alike, that are present in the in-memory ring buffers, as :class:`LuaRingEntry` objects.

.. function:: loadTLSEngine(engineName [, defaultString])

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Load the OpenSSL engine named ``engineName``, setting the engine default string to ``defaultString`` if supplied. Engines can be used to accelerate cryptographic operations, like for example Intel QAT.
  At the moment up to a maximum of 32 loaded engines are supported, and that support is experimental.
  Some engines might actually degrade performance unless the TLS asynchronous mode of OpenSSL is enabled. To enable it see the ``tlsAsyncMode`` parameter on :func:`addTLSLocal`.

  :param string engineName: The name of the engine to load.
  :param string defaultString: The default string to pass to the engine. The exact value depends on the engine but represents the algorithms to register with the engine, as a list of  comma-separated keywords. For example "RSA,EC,DSA,DH,PKEY,PKEY_CRYPTO,PKEY_ASN1".

.. function:: loadTLSProvider(providerName)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Load the OpenSSL provider named ``providerName``. Providers can be used to accelerate cryptographic operations, like for example Intel QAT.
  At the moment up to a maximum of 32 loaded providers are supported, and that support is experimental.
  Note that :func:`loadTLSProvider` is only available when building against OpenSSL version >= 3.0 and with the `--enable-tls-provider` configure flag on. In other cases, :func:`loadTLSEngine` should be used instead.
  Some providers might actually degrade performance unless the TLS asynchronous mode of OpenSSL is enabled. To enable it see the ``tlsAsyncMode`` parameter on :func:`addTLSLocal`.

  :param string providerName: The name of the provider to load.

.. function:: newTLSCertificate(pathToCert[, options])

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Creates a TLSCertificate object suited to be used with functions like :func:`addDOHLocal` and :func:`addTLSLocal` for TLS certificate configuration.

  PKCS12 files are only supported by the ``openssl`` provider, password-protected or not.

  :param string pathToCert: Path to a file containing the certificate or a PKCS12 file containing both a certificate and a key.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with additional options.

  Options:

  * ``key="path/to/key"``: string - Path to a file containing the key corresponding to the certificate.
  * ``password="pass"``: string - Password protecting the PKCS12 file if appropriate.

  .. code-block:: lua

    newTLSCertificate("path/to/pub.crt", {key="path/to/private.pem"})
    newTLSCertificate("path/to/domain.p12", {password="passphrase"}) -- use a password protected PKCS12 file

  .. method:: DOHFrontend:loadTicketsKeys(ticketsKeysFile)

     Load new tickets keys from the selected file, replacing the existing ones. These keys should be rotated often and never written to persistent storage to preserve forward secrecy. The default is to generate a random key. dnsdist supports several tickets keys to be able to decrypt existing sessions after the rotation.
     See :doc:`../advanced/tls-sessions-management` for more information.

    :param str ticketsKeysFile: The path to a file from where TLS tickets keys should be loaded.

  .. method:: DOHFrontend:reloadCertificates()

     Reload the current TLS certificate and key pairs.

     Replace the current TLS tickets key by a new random one.

  .. method:: DOHFrontend:setResponsesMap(rules)

     Set a list of HTTP response rules allowing to intercept HTTP queries very early, before the DNS payload has been processed, and send custom responses including error pages, redirects and static content.

     :param list of DOHResponseMapEntry objects rules: A list of DOHResponseMapEntry objects, obtained with :func:`newDOHResponseMapEntry`.


.. function:: newDOHResponseMapEntry(regex, status, content [, headers]) -> DOHResponseMapEntry

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Return a DOHResponseMapEntry that can be used with :meth:`DOHFrontend:setResponsesMap`. Every query whose path is listed in the ``urls`` parameter to :func:`addDOHLocal` and matches the regular expression supplied in ``regex`` will be immediately answered with a HTTP response.
  The status of the HTTP response will be the one supplied by ``status``, and the content set to the one supplied by ``content``, except if the status is a redirection (3xx) in which case the content is expected to be the URL to redirect to.

  :param str regex: A regular expression to match the path against.
  :param int status: The HTTP code to answer with.
  :param str content: The content of the HTTP response, or a URL if the status is a redirection (3xx).

EDNS on Self-generated answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several mechanisms in dnsdist that turn an existing query into an answer right away,
without reaching out to the backend, including :func:`SpoofAction`, :func:`RCodeAction`, :func:`TCAction`
and returning a response from ``Lua``. Those responses should, according to :rfc:`6891`, contain an ``OPT``
record if the received request had one, which is the case by default and can be disabled using
:func:`setAddEDNSToSelfGeneratedResponses`.

We must, however, provide a responder's maximum payload size in this record, and we can't easily know the
maximum payload size of the actual backend so we need to provide one. The default value is 1232 since 1.6.0,
and can be overridden using :func:`setPayloadSizeOnSelfGeneratedAnswers`.

.. function:: setAddEDNSToSelfGeneratedResponses(add)

  Whether to add EDNS to self-generated responses, provided that the initial query had EDNS.

  :param bool add: Whether to add EDNS, default is true.

.. function:: setPayloadSizeOnSelfGeneratedAnswers(payloadSize)

  .. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
    Default value changed from 1500 to 1232.

  Set the UDP payload size advertised via EDNS on self-generated responses. In accordance with
  :rfc:`RFC 6891 <6891#section-6.2.5>`, values lower than 512 will be treated as equal to 512.

  :param int payloadSize: The responder's maximum UDP payload size, in bytes. Default is 1232 since 1.6.0, it was 1500 before.

Security Polling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PowerDNS products can poll the security status of their respective versions. This polling, naturally,
happens over DNS. If the result is that a given version has a security problem, the software will
report this at level ‘Error’ during startup, and repeatedly during operations, every
:func:`setSecurityPollInterval` seconds.

By default, security polling happens on the domain ‘secpoll.powerdns.com’, but this can be changed with
the :func:`setSecurityPollSuffix` function. If this setting is made empty, no polling will take place.
Organizations wanting to host their own security zones can do so by changing this setting to a domain name
under their control.

To enable distributors of PowerDNS to signal that they have backported versions, the PACKAGEVERSION
compilation-time macro can be used to set a distributor suffix.

.. function:: setSecurityPollInterval(interval)

  Set the interval, in seconds, between two security polls.

  :param int interval: The interval, in seconds, between two polls. Default is 3600.

.. function:: setSecurityPollSuffix(suffix)

  Domain name from which to query security update notifications. Setting this to an empty string disables secpoll.

  :param string suffix: The suffix to use, default is 'secpoll.powerdns.com.'.
