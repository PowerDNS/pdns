Configuration Reference
=======================

This page lists all configuration options for dnsdist.

.. note::

  When an IPv6 IP:PORT combination is needed, the bracketed syntax from :rfc:`RFC 3986 <3986#section-3.2.2>` should be used.
  e.g. "[2001:DB8:14::C0FF:FEE]:5300".

Functions and Types
-------------------

Within dnsdist several core object types exist:

* :class:`Server`: generated with :func:`newServer`, represents a downstream server
* :class:`ComboAddress`: represents an IP address and port
* :class:`DNSName`: represents a domain name
* :class:`NetmaskGroup`: represents a group of netmasks
* :class:`QPSLimiter`: implements a QPS-based filter
* :class:`SuffixMatchNode`: represents a group of domain suffixes for rapid testing of membership
* :class:`DNSHeader`: represents the header of a DNS packet, see :ref:`DNSHeader`
* :class:`ClientState`: sometimes also called Bind or Frontend, represents the addresses and ports dnsdist is listening on

The existence of most of these objects can mostly be ignored, unless you plan to write your own hooks and policies, but it helps to understand an expressions like:

.. code-block:: lua

  getServer(0).order=12         -- set order of server 0 to 12
  getServer(0):addPool("abuse") -- add this server to the abuse pool

The ``.`` means ``order`` is a data member, while the ``:`` means ``addPool`` is a member function.

Global configuration
--------------------

.. function:: includeDirectory(path)

  Include configuration files from ``path``.

  :param str path: The directory to load configuration files from. Each file must end in ``.conf``.

.. function:: reloadAllCertificates()

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Reload all DNSCrypt and TLS certificates, along with their associated keys.

.. function:: setSyslogFacility(facility)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  :param str certFile(s): The path to a X.509 certificate file in PEM format, or a list of paths to such files.
  :param str keyFile(s): The path to the private key file corresponding to the certificate, or a list of paths to such files, whose order should match the certFile(s) ones.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with listen options.

  Options:

  * ``ciphers``: str - The TLS ciphers to use. The exact format depends on the provider used. When the OpenSSL provder is used, ciphers for TLS 1.3 must be specified via ``ciphersTLS13``.
  * ``ciphersTLS13``: str - The ciphers to use for TLS 1.3, when the OpenSSL provider is used. When the GnuTLS provider is used, ``ciphers`` applies regardless of the TLS protocol and this setting is not used.
  * ``numberOfTicketsKeys``: int - The maximum number of tickets keys to keep in memory at the same time, if the provider supports it (GnuTLS doesn't, OpenSSL does). Only one key is marked as active and used to encrypt new tickets while the remaining ones can still be used to decrypt existing tickets after a rotation. Default to 5.
  * ``ticketKeyFile``: str - The path to a file from where TLS tickets keys should be loaded, to support RFC 5077. These keys should be rotated often and never written to persistent storage to preserve forward secrecy. The default is to generate a random key. The OpenSSL provider supports several tickets keys to be able to decrypt existing sessions after the rotation, while the GnuTLS provider only supports one key.
  * ``ticketsKeysRotationDelay``: int - Set the delay before the TLS tickets key is rotated, in seconds. Default is 43200 (12h).
  * ``sessionTickets``: bool - Whether session resumption via session tickets is enabled. Default is true, meaning tickets are enabled.
  * ``numberOfStoredSessions``: int - The maximum number of sessions kept in memory at the same time. At this time this is only supported by the OpenSSL provider, as stored sessions are not supported with the GnuTLS one. Default is 20480. Setting this value to 0 disables stored session entirely.

Server Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A server object returned by :func:`getServer` can be manipulated with these functions.

.. class:: Server

  This object represents a backend server. It has several methods.

  .. method:: Server:addPool(pool)

    Add this server to a pool.

    :param str pool: The pool to add the server to

  .. method:: Server:getName() -> string

    Get the name of this server.

    :returns: The name of the server, or an empty string if it does not have one

  .. method:: Server:getNameWithAddr() -> string

    Get the name plus IP address and port of the server

    :returns: A string containing the server name if any plus the server address and port

  .. method:: Server:getOutstanding() -> int

    Get the number of outstanding queries for this server.

    :returns: The number of outstanding queries

  .. method:: Server:isUp() -> bool

    Returns the up status of the server

    :returns: true when the server is up, false otherwise

  .. method:: Server:rmPool(pool)

    Removes the server from the named pool

    :param str pool: The pool to remove the server from

  .. method:: Server:setAuto([status])

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0
        ``status`` optional parameter added.

    Set the server in the default auto state.
    This will enable health check queries that will set the server ``up`` and ``down`` appropriately.

    :param bool status: Set the initial status of the server to ``up`` (true) or ``down`` (false) instead of using the last known status

  .. method:: Server:setQPS(limit)

    Limit the queries per second for this server.

    :param int limit: The maximum number of queries per second

  .. method:: Server:setDown()

    Set the server in an ``DOWN`` state.
    The server will not receive queries and the health checks are disabled

  .. method:: Server:setUp()

    Set the server in an ``UP`` state.
    This server will still receive queries and health checks are disabled

  Apart from the functions, a :class:`Server` object has these attributes:

  .. attribute:: Server.name

    The name of the server

  .. attribute:: Server.upStatus

    Whether or not this server is up or down

  .. attribute:: Server.order

    The order of the server

  .. attribute:: Server.weight

    The weight of the server

Pools
-----

:class:`Server`\ s can be part of any number of pools.
Pools are automatically created when a server is added to a pool (with :func:`newServer`), or can be manually created with :func:`addPool`.

.. function:: addPool(name) -> ServerPool

  Returns a :class:`ServerPool`.

  :param string name: The name of the pool to create

.. function:: getPool(name) -> ServerPool

  Returns a :class:`ServerPool` or nil.

  :param string name: The name of the pool

.. function:: getPoolServers(name) -> [ Server ]

  Returns a list of :class:`Server`\ s or nil.

  :param string name: The name of the pool

.. function:: showPools()

   Display the name, associated cache, server policy and associated servers for every pool.

.. class:: ServerPool

  This represents the pool where zero or more servers are part of.

  .. method:: ServerPool:getCache() -> PacketCache

    Returns the :class:`PacketCache` for this pool or nil.

  .. method:: ServerPool:getECS()

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    Whether dnsdist will add EDNS Client Subnet information to the query before looking up into the cache,
    when all servers from this pool are down. For more information see :meth:`ServerPool:setECS`.

  .. method:: ServerPool:setCache(cache)

    Adds ``cache`` as the pool's cache.

    :param PacketCache cache: The new cache to add to the pool

  .. method:: ServerPool:unsetCache()

    Removes the cache from this pool.

  .. method:: ServerPool:setECS()

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    Set to true if dnsdist should add EDNS Client Subnet information to the query before looking up into the cache,
    when all servers from this pool are down. If at least one server is up, the preference of the
    selected server is used, this parameter is only useful if all the backends in this pool are down
    and have EDNS Client Subnet enabled, since the queries in the cache will have been inserted with
    ECS information. Default is false.

PacketCache
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Pool can have a packet cache to answer queries directly instead of going to the backend.
See :doc:`../guides/cache` for a how to.

.. function:: newPacketCache(maxEntries[, maxTTL=86400[, minTTL=0[, temporaryFailureTTL=60[, staleTTL=60[, dontAge=false[, numberOfShards=1[, deferrableInsertLock=true[, maxNegativeTTL=3600[, parseECS=false]]]]]]]) -> PacketCache

  .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0
    ``numberOfShards`` and ``deferrableInsertLock`` parameters added.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.3.1
    ``maxNegativeTTL`` and ``parseECS`` parameters added.

  .. deprecated:: 1.4.0

  Creates a new :class:`PacketCache` with the settings specified.

DynBlockRulesGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using several `exceed*()` lines, dnsdist 1.3.0 introduced a new `DynBlockRulesGroup` object
which can be used to group dynamic block rules.

See :doc:`../guides/dynblocks` for more information about the case where using a `DynBlockRulesGroup` might be
faster than the existing rules.

.. function:: dynBlockRulesGroup() -> DynBlockRulesGroup

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3.3
        ``warningRate`` parameter added.

    Adds a rate-limiting rule for queries of type ``qtype``, equivalent to:

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:excludeRange(netmasks)

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.1

    Exclude this range, or list of ranges, meaning that no dynamic block will ever be inserted for clients in that range. Default to empty, meaning rules are applied to all ranges. When used in combination with :meth:`DynBlockRulesGroup:includeRange`, the more specific entry wins.

    :param int netmasks: A netmask, or list of netmasks, as strings, like for example "192.0.2.1/24"

  .. method:: DynBlockRulesGroup:includeRange(netmasks)

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.1

    Return a string describing the rules and range exclusions of this DynBlockRulesGroup.

SuffixMatchNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A SuffixMatchNode can be used to quickly check whether a given name belongs to a set or not. This is achieved
using an efficient tree structure based on DNS labels, making lookups cheap.
Be careful that Suffix Node matching will match for any sub-domain, regardless of the depth, under the name added to the set. For example,
if 'example.com.' is added to the set, 'www.example.com.' and 'sub.www.example.com.' will match as well.
If you are looking for exact name matching, your might want to consider using a :class:`DNSNameSet` instead.

.. function:: newSuffixMatchNode()

  Creates a new :class:`SuffixMatchNode`.

.. class:: SuffixMatchNode

  Represent a set of DNS suffixes for quick matching.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:add(name)

    Add a suffix to the current set.

    :param DNSName name: The suffix to add to the set.

  .. method:: SuffixMatchNode:check(name) -> bool

    Return true if the given name is a sub-domain of one of those in the set, and false otherwise.

    :param DNSName name: The name to test against the set.

Other functions
---------------

.. function:: maintenance()

  If this function exists, it is called every second to so regular tasks.
  This can be used for e.g. :doc:`Dynamic Blocks <../guides/dynblocks>`.

.. function:: setAllowEmptyResponse()

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Set to true (defaults to false) to allow empty responses (qdcount=0) with a NoError or NXDomain rcode (default) from backends. dnsdist drops these responses by default because it can't match them against the initial query since they don't contain the qname, qtype and qclass, and therefore the risk of collision is much higher than with regular responses.

.. function:: makeIPCipherKey(password) -> string

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Hashes the password to generate a 16-byte key that can be used to pseudonymize IP addresses with IP cipher.

DOHFrontend
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: DOHFrontend

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  This object represents an address and port dnsdist is listening on for DNS over HTTPS queries.

  .. method:: DOHFrontend:reloadCertificates()

     Reload the current TLS certificate and key pairs.

TLSContext
~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: TLSContext

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

  This object represents an address and port dnsdist is listening on for DNS over TLS queries.

  .. method:: TLSContext:rotateTicketsKey()

     Replace the current TLS tickets key by a new random one.

  .. method:: TLSContext:loadTicketsKeys(ticketsKeysFile)

     Load new tickets keys from the selected file, replacing the existing ones. These keys should be rotated often and never written to persistent storage to preserve forward secrecy. The default is to generate a random key. The OpenSSL provider supports several tickets keys to be able to decrypt existing sessions after the rotation, while the GnuTLS provider only supports one key.

    :param str ticketsKeysFile: The path to a file from where TLS tickets keys should be loaded.

TLSFrontend
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. class:: TLSFrontend

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.1

  This object represents the configuration of a listening frontend for DNS over TLS queries. To each frontend is associated a TLSContext.

  .. method:: TLSContext:loadNewCertificatesAndKeys(certFile(s), keyFile(s))

     Create and switch to a new TLS context using the same options than were passed to the corresponding `addTLSLocal()` directive, but loading new certificates and keys from the selected files, replacing the existing ones.

  :param str certFile(s): The path to a X.509 certificate file in PEM format, or a list of paths to such files.
  :param str keyFile(s): The path to the private key file corresponding to the certificate, or a list of paths to such files, whose order should match the certFile(s) ones.

EDNS on Self-generated answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several mechanisms in dnsdist that turn an existing query into an answer right away,
without reaching out to the backend, including :func:`SpoofAction`, :func:`RCodeAction`, :func:`TCAction`
and returning a response from ``Lua``. Those responses should, according to :rfc:`6891`, contain an ``OPT``
record if the received request had one, which is the case by default and can be disabled using
:func:`setAddEDNSToSelfGeneratedResponses`.

We must, however, provide a responder's maximum payload size in this record, and we can't easily know the
maximum payload size of the actual backend so we need to provide one. The default value is 1500 and can be
overriden using :func:`setPayloadSizeOnSelfGeneratedAnswers`.

.. function:: setAddEDNSToSelfGeneratedResponses(add)

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.3

  Whether to add EDNS to self-generated responses, provided that the initial query had EDNS.

  :param bool add: Whether to add EDNS, default is true.

.. function:: setPayloadSizeOnSelfGeneratedAnswers(payloadSize)

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.3

  Set the UDP payload size advertised via EDNS on self-generated responses. In accordance with
  :rfc:`RFC 6891 <6891#section-6.2.5>`, values lower than 512 will be treated as equal to 512.

  :param int payloadSize: The responder's maximum UDP payload size, in bytes. Default is 1500.

Security Polling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PowerDNS products can poll the security status of their respective versions. This polling, naturally,
happens over DNS. If the result is that a given version has a security problem, the software will
report this at level ‘Error’ during startup, and repeatedly during operations, every
:func:`setSecurityPollInterval` seconds.

By default, security polling happens on the domain ‘secpoll.powerdns.com’, but this can be changed with
the :func:`setSecurityPollSuffix` function. If this setting is made empty, no polling will take place.
Organizations wanting to host their own security zones can do so by changing this setting to a domain name
under their control.

To enable distributors of PowerDNS to signal that they have backported versions, the PACKAGEVERSION
compilation-time macro can be used to set a distributor suffix.

.. function:: setSecurityPollInterval(interval)

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.3

  Set the interval, in seconds, between two security pollings.

  :param int interval: The interval, in seconds, between two pollings. Default is 3600.

.. function:: setSecurityPollSuffix(suffix)

  .. versionadded:: 1.3.3

  Domain name from which to query security update notifications. Setting this to an empty string disables secpoll.

  :param string suffix: The suffix to use, default is 'secpoll.powerdns.com.'.
