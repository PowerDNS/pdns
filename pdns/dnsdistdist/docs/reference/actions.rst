Rule Actions
============

:doc:`selectors` need to be combined with an action for them to actually do something with the matched packets.
Some actions allow further processing of rules, this is noted in their description. Most of these start with 'Set' with a few exceptions, mostly for logging actions. These exceptions are:

- :func:`ClearRecordTypesResponseAction`
- :func:`KeyValueStoreLookupAction`
- :func:`DnstapLogAction`
- :func:`DnstapLogResponseAction`
- :func:`LimitTTLResponseAction`
- :func:`LogAction`
- :func:`LogResponseAction`
- :func:`NoneAction`
- :func:`RemoteLogAction`
- :func:`RemoteLogResponseAction`
- :func:`SNMPTrapAction`
- :func:`SNMPTrapResponseAction`
- :func:`TeeAction`

The following actions exist.

.. function:: AllowAction()

  Let these packets go through.

.. function:: AllowResponseAction()

  Let these packets go through.

.. function:: ClearRecordTypesResponseAction(types)

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Removes given type(s) records from the response. Beware you can accidentally turn the answer into a NODATA response
  without a SOA record in the additional section in which case you may want to use :func:`NegativeAndSOAAction` to generate an answer,
  see example below.
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  .. code-block:: Lua

    -- removes any HTTPS record in the response
    addResponseAction(
            QNameRule('www.example.com.'),
            ClearRecordTypesResponseAction(DNSQType.HTTPS)
    )
    -- reply directly with NODATA and a SOA record as we know the answer will be empty
    addAction(
            AndRule{QNameRule('www.example.com.'), QTypeRule(DNSQType.HTTPS)},
            NegativeAndSOAAction(false, 'example.com.', 3600, 'ns.example.com.', 'postmaster.example.com.', 1, 1800, 900, 604800, 86400)
    )

  :param int types: a single type or a list of types to remove

.. function:: ContinueAction(action)

  :param int action: Any other action

.. function:: DelayAction(milliseconds)

  Delay the response by the specified amount of milliseconds (UDP-only). Note that the sending of the query to the backend, if needed,
  is not delayed. Only the sending of the response to the client will be delayed.
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param int milliseconds: The amount of milliseconds to delay the response

.. function:: DelayResponseAction(milliseconds)

  Delay the response by the specified amount of milliseconds (UDP-only).
  The only difference between this action and  :func:`DelayAction` is that they can only be applied on, respectively, responses and queries.

  :param int v4: The IPv4 netmask length
  :param int v6: The IPv6 netmask length

.. function:: ERCodeAction(rcode [, options])

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    Added the optional parameter ``options``.

  Reply immediately by turning the query into a response with the specified EDNS extended ``rcode``.
  ``rcode`` can be specified as an integer or as one of the built-in :ref:`DNSRCode`.

  :param int rcode: The extended RCODE to respond with.
  :param table options: A table with key: value pairs with options.

  Options:

  * ``aa``: bool - Set the AA bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to clear it.
  * ``ad``: bool - Set the AD bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to clear it.
  * ``ra``: bool - Set the RA bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to copy the value of the RD bit from the incoming query.

.. function:: HTTPStatusAction(status, body, contentType="" [, options])

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
    Added the optional parameter ``options``.

  Return an HTTP response with a status code of ''status''. For HTTP redirects, ''body'' should be the redirect URL.

  :param int status: The HTTP status code to return.
  :param string body: The body of the HTTP response, or a URL if the status code is a redirect (3xx).
  :param string contentType: The HTTP Content-Type header to return for a 200 response, ignored otherwise. Default is ''application/dns-message''.

  * ``ra``: bool - Set the RA bit to this value (true means the bit is set, false means it's cleared). Default is to copy the value of the RD bit from the incoming query.

.. function:: KeyValueStoreLookupAction(kvs, lookupKey, destinationTag)

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.0

  Does a lookup into the key value store referenced by 'kvs' using the key returned by 'lookupKey',
  and storing the result if any into the tag named 'destinationTag'.
  The store can be a CDB (:func:`newCDBKVStore`) or a LMDB database (:func:`newLMDBKVStore`).
  The key can be based on the qname (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeyQName` and :func:`KeyValueLookupKeySuffix`),
  source IP (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeySourceIP`) or the value of an existing tag (:func:`KeyValueLookupKeyTag`).
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.
  Note that the tag is always created, even if there was no match, but in that case the content is empty.

  :param KeyValueStore kvs: The key value store to query
  :param KeyValueLookupKey lookupKey: The key to use for the lookup
  :param string destinationTag: The name of the tag to store the result into

.. function:: KeyValueStoreRangeLookupAction(kvs, lookupKey, destinationTag)

  .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

  Does a range-based lookup into the key value store referenced by 'kvs' using the key returned by 'lookupKey',
  and storing the result if any into the tag named 'destinationTag'.
  This assumes that there is a key in network byte order for the last element of the range (for example 2001:0db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff for 2001:db8::/32) which contains the first element of the range (2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000) (optionally followed by any data) as value, also in network byte order, and that there is no overlapping ranges in the database.
  This requires that the underlying store supports ordered keys, which is true for LMDB but not for CDB.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param KeyValueStore kvs: The key value store to query
  :param KeyValueLookupKey lookupKey: The key to use for the lookup
  :param string destinationTag: The name of the tag to store the result into

.. function:: LimitTTLResponseAction(min[, max [, types]])

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Cap the TTLs of the response to the given boundaries.

  :param int min: The minimum allowed value
  :param int max: The maximum allowed value
  :param list of int: The record types to cap the TTL for. Default is empty which means all records will be capped.

.. function:: LogAction([filename[, binary[, append[, buffered[, verboseOnly[, includeTimestamp]]]]]])

  .. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
    Added the optional parameters ``verboseOnly`` and ``includeTimestamp``, made ``filename`` optional.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.7.0
    Added the ``reload`` method.

  Log a line for each query, to the specified ``file`` if any, to the console (require verbose) if the empty string is given as filename.

  If an empty string is supplied in the file name, the logging is done to stdout, and only in verbose mode by default. This can be changed by setting ``verboseOnly`` to false.

  When logging to a file, the ``binary`` optional parameter specifies whether we log in binary form (default) or in textual form. Before 1.4.0 the binary log format only included the qname and qtype. Since 1.4.0 it includes an optional timestamp, the query ID, qname, qtype, remote address and port.

  The ``append`` optional parameter specifies whether we open the file for appending or truncate each time (default).
  The ``buffered`` optional parameter specifies whether writes to the file are buffered (default) or not.

  Since 1.7.0 calling the ``reload()`` method on the object will cause it to close and re-open the log file, for rotation purposes.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param string filename: File to log to. Set to an empty string to log to the normal stdout log, this only works when ``-v`` is set on the command line.
  :param bool binary: Do binary logging. Default true
  :param bool append: Append to the log. Default false
  :param bool buffered: Use buffered I/O. Default true
  :param bool verboseOnly: Whether to log only in verbose mode when logging to stdout. Default is true
  :param bool includeTimestamp: Whether to include a timestamp for every entry. Default is false

.. function:: LogResponseAction([filename[, append[, buffered[, verboseOnly[, includeTimestamp]]]]]])

  .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

  .. versionchanged:: 1.7.0
    Added the ``reload`` method.

  If an empty string is supplied in the file name, the logging is done to stdout, and only in verbose mode by default. This can be changed by setting ``verboseOnly`` to false.

  The ``append`` optional parameter specifies whether we open the file for appending or truncate each time (default).
  The ``buffered`` optional parameter specifies whether writes to the file are buffered (default) or not.

  Since 1.7.0 calling the ``reload()`` method on the object will cause it to close and re-open the log file, for rotation purposes.

  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param string filename: File to log to. Set to an empty string to log to the normal stdout log, this only works when ``-v`` is set on the command line.
  :param bool append: Append to the log. Default false
  :param bool buffered: Use buffered I/O. Default true
  :param bool verboseOnly: Whether to log only in verbose mode when logging to stdout. Default is true
  :param bool includeTimestamp: Whether to include a timestamp for every entry. Default is false

  Send the content of this query to a remote logger via Protocol Buffer.
  ``alterFunction`` is a callback, receiving a :class:`DNSQuestion` and a :class:`DNSDistProtoBufMessage`, that can be used to modify the Protocol Buffer content, for example for anonymization purposes.
  Since 1.8.0 it is possible to add configurable meta-data fields to the Protocol Buffer message via the ``metas`` parameter, which takes a list of ``name``=``key`` pairs. For each entry in the list, a new value named ``name``
  will be added to the message with the value corresponding to the ``key``. Available keys are:

  ``alterFunction`` is the same callback that receiving a :class:`DNSQuestion` and a :class:`DNSDistProtoBufMessage`, that can be used to modify the Protocol Buffer content, for example for anonymization purposes.
  ``includeCNAME`` indicates whether CNAME records inside the response should be parsed and exported.
  The default is to only exports A and AAAA records.
  Since 1.8.0 it is possible to add configurable meta-data fields to the Protocol Buffer message via the ``metas`` parameter, which takes a list of ``name``=``key`` pairs. See :func:`RemoteLogAction` for the list of available keys.
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

.. function:: SetAdditionalProxyProtocolValueAction(type, value)

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

  Add a Proxy-Protocol Type-Length value to be sent to the server along with this query. It does not replace any
  existing value with the same type but adds a new value.
  Be careful that Proxy Protocol values are sent once at the beginning of the TCP connection for TCP and DoT queries.
  That means that values received on an incoming TCP connection will be inherited by subsequent queries received over
  the same incoming TCP connection, if any, but values set to a query will not be inherited by subsequent queries.
  Subsequent rules are processed after this action.

  :param int type: The type of the value to send, ranging from 0 to 255 (both included)
