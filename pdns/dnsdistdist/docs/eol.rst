End of life statements
======================

We aim to have a major release every six months. The latest major release train receives correctness, stability and security updates by the way of minor releases. We support older release trains with critical updates for one year after the subsequent major release.

Older releases are marked end of life and receive no updates at all. Pre-releases do not receive immediate security updates.

The currently supported release train of PowerDNS DNSdist is 2.0.

PowerDNS DNSdist 1.9 will only receive critical updates and will be End of Life one year after PowerDNS DNSdist 2.0 was released.

Older versions are End of Life.

Please refer to the support `commitment <https://www.powerdns.com/support-commitment>`_ for details on which versions are supported.

.. note::
  Users with a commercial agreement with PowerDNS.com B.V. or Open-Xchange can receive support for releases which are End Of Life. If you are such a user, these EOL statements do not apply to you.
  Note that for the Open Source support channels, we only support the latest minor release of a release train. That means that we ask you to reproduce potential issues on the latest minor release first.
