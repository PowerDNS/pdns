End of life statements
======================

We aim to have a major release every six months. The latest major release train receives correctness, stability and security updates by the way of minor releases. We support older releases with critical updates for one year after the following major release.

Older releases are marked end of life and receive no updates at all. Pre-releases do not receive immediate security updates.

The currently supported release train of PowerDNS DNSdist is 1.9.

PowerDNS DNSdist 1.8 will only receive critical updates and will be End of Life one year after PowerDNS DNSdist 1.9 was released.

PowerDNS DNSdist 1.7 will only receive critical updates and will be End of Life one year after PowerDNS DNSdist 1.8 was released.

Older versions are End of Life.

.. note::
  Users with a commercial agreement with PowerDNS.COM BV or Open-Xchange can receive extended support for releases which are End Of Life. If you are such a user, these EOL statements do not apply to you. Please refer to the support commitment for details. Note that for the Open Source support channels we only support the latest minor release of a release train. That means that we ask you to reproduce potential issues on the latest minor release first.
