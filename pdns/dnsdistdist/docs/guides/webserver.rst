Built-in webserver
==================

To visually interact with dnsdist, try add :func:`webserver` to the configuration:

.. code-block:: lua

  webserver("127.0.0.1:8083", "supersecretpassword", "supersecretAPIkey")

Now point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8083 and log in with any username, and that password. Enjoy!

Security of the Webserver
-------------------------

The built-in webserver serves its content from inside the binary, this means it will not and connot read from disk.

By default, our web server sends some security-related headers::

   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: deny
   X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'

You can override those headers, or add custom headers by using the last parameter to :func:`webserver`.
For example, to remove the X-Frame-Options header and add a X-Custom one:

.. code-block:: lua

  webserver("127.0.0.1:8080", "supersecret", "apikey", {["X-Frame-Options"]= "", ["X-Custom"]="custom"}

dnsdist API
-----------

To access the API, the `apikey` must be set in the :func:`webserver` function.
Use the API, this key will need to be sent to dnsdist in the ``X-API-Key`` request header.
An HTTP 401 response is returned when a wrong or no API key is received.
A 404 response is generated is the requested endpoint does not exist.
And a 405 response is returned when the HTTP methos is not allowed.

URL Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:get:: /jsonstat

  Get statistics from dnsdist in JSON format.
  The ``Accept`` request header is ignored.
  This endpoint accepts a ``command`` query for different statistics:

  * ``stats``: Get all :doc:`../statistics` as a JSON dict
  * ``dynblocklist``: Get all current :doc:`dynamic blocks <dynblocks>`, keyed by netmask
  * ``ebpfblocklist``: Idem, but for :doc:`eBPF <../advanced/ebpf>` blocks

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /jsonstat?command=stats HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
