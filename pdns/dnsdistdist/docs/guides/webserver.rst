Built-in webserver
==================

To visually interact with dnsdist, try adding :func:`webserver` and :func:`setWebserverConfig` directives to the configuration:

.. code-block:: lua

  webserver("127.0.0.1:8083")
  setWebserverConfig({password="supersecretpassword", apiKey="supersecretAPIkey"})

Now point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8083 and log in with any username, and that password. Enjoy!

Since 1.5.0, only connections from 127.0.0.1 and ::1 are allowed by default. To allow connections from 192.0.2.0/24 but not from 192.0.2.1, instead:

.. code-block:: lua

  setWebserverConfig({password="supersecretpassword", apiKey="supersecretAPIkey", acl="192.0.2.0/24, !192.0.2.1"})


Security of the Webserver
-------------------------

The built-in webserver serves its content from inside the binary, this means it will not and cannot read from disk.

By default, our web server sends some security-related headers::

   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: deny
   X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'

You can override those headers, or add custom headers by using the last parameter to :func:`webserver`.
For example, to remove the X-Frame-Options header and add a X-Custom one:

.. code-block:: lua

  setWebserverConfig({password="supersecretpassword", apiKey="supersecretAPIkey", customHeaders={["X-Frame-Options"]= "", ["X-Custom"]="custom"} })

Credentials can be changed at run time using the :func:`setWebserverConfig` function.

dnsdist API
-----------

To access the API, the `apikey` must be set in the :func:`webserver` function.
Use the API, this key will need to be sent to dnsdist in the ``X-API-Key`` request header.
An HTTP 401 response is returned when a wrong or no API key is received.
A 404 response is generated is the requested endpoint does not exist.
And a 405 response is returned when the HTTP method is not allowed.

URL Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:get:: /jsonstat

  Get statistics from dnsdist in JSON format.
  The ``Accept`` request header is ignored.
  This endpoint accepts a ``command`` query for different statistics:

  * ``stats``: Get all :doc:`../statistics` as a JSON dict
  * ``dynblocklist``: Get all current :doc:`dynamic blocks <dynblocks>`, keyed by netmask
  * ``ebpfblocklist``: Idem, but for :doc:`eBPF <../advanced/ebpf>` blocks

  **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /jsonstat?command=stats HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json, text/javascript

  **Example prometheus configuration**:

   This is just the scrape job description, for details see the prometheus documentation.

   .. sourcecode:: yaml

      job_name: dnsdist
      scrape_interval: 10s
      scrape_timeout: 2s
      metrics_path: /metrics
      basic_auth:
        username: dontcare
        password: yoursecret

.. http:delete:: /api/v1/cache?pool=<pool-name>&name=<dns-name>[&type=<dns-type>][&suffix=]

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.0

  Allows removing entries from a cache. The pool to which the cache is associated should be specified in the ``pool`` parameter, and the name to remove in the ``name`` parameter.
  By default only entries matching the exact name will be removed, but it is possible to remove all entries below that name by passing the ``suffix`` parameter set to any value.
  By default entries for all types for the name are removed, but it is possible to only remove entries for a specific type by passing the ``type`` parameter set to the requested type. Supported values are DNS type names as a strings (``AAAA``), or numerical values (as either ``#64`` or ``TYPE64``).

  **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      DELETE /api/v1/cache?pool=&name=free.fr HTTP/1.1
      Accept: */*
      Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
      Connection: keep-alive

  **Example response**:
   .. sourcecode:: http
