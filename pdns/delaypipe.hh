/**
   General idea: many threads submit work to this class, but only one executes it. The work should therefore be entirely trivial.
   The implementation is that submitter threads create an object that represents the work, and it gets sent over a pipe 
   to the worker thread.

   The worker thread meanwhile listens on this pipe (non-blocking), with a delay set to the next object that needs to be executed.
   If meanwhile new work comes in, all objects who's time has come are executed, a new sleep time is calculated.
