/**

how will this work.

This is a thread that just throws packets around. Should handle ~1000 packets/second.

Consists of a thread receiving packets back from the backend and retransmitting them to the original client.

Furthermore, it provides a member function that reports the packet to the connection tracker and actually sends it out. 

The sending happens from a source port that is determined by the constructor, but IS random. Furthermore, the ID is XOR-ed with a random value
to make sure outside parties can't spoof us.

To fix: how to remove the stale entries that will surely accumulate
