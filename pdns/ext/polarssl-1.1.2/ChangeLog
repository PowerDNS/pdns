PolarSSL ChangeLog

= Version 1.1.2 released on 2012-04-26
Bugfix
   * Fixed handling error in mpi_cmp_mpi() on longer B values (found by
     Hui Dong)

Security
   * Fixed potential memory corruption on miscrafted client messages (found by
     Frama-C team at CEA LIST)
   * Fixed generation of DHM parameters to correct length (found by Ruslan
     Yushchenko)

= Version 1.1.1 released on 2012-01-23
Bugfix
   * Check for failed malloc() in ssl_set_hostname() and x509_get_entries()
     (Closes ticket #47, found by Hugo Leisink)
   * Fixed issues with Intel compiler on 64-bit systems (Closes ticket #50)
   * Fixed multiple compiler warnings for VS6 and armcc
   * Fixed bug in CTR_CRBG selftest

= Version 1.1.0 released on 2011-12-22
Features
   * Added ssl_session_reset() to allow better multi-connection pools of
     SSL contexts without needing to set all non-connection-specific
     data and pointers again. Adapted ssl_server to use this functionality.
   * Added ssl_set_max_version() to allow clients to offer a lower maximum
     supported version to a server to help buggy server implementations.
     (Closes ticket #36)
   * Added cipher_get_cipher_mode() and cipher_get_cipher_operation()
     introspection functions (Closes ticket #40)
   * Added CTR_DRBG based on AES-256-CTR (NIST SP 800-90) random generator
   * Added a generic entropy accumulator that provides support for adding
     custom entropy sources and added some generic and platform dependent
     entropy sources

Changes
   * Documentation for AES and Camellia in modes CTR and CFB128 clarified.
   * Fixed rsa_encrypt and rsa_decrypt examples to use public key for
     encryption and private key for decryption. (Closes ticket #34)
   * Inceased maximum size of ASN1 length reads to 32-bits.
   * Added an EXPLICIT tag number parameter to x509_get_ext()
   * Added a separate CRL entry extension parsing function
   * Separated the ASN.1 parsing code from the X.509 specific parsing code.
     So now there is a module that is controlled with POLARSSL_ASN1_PARSE_C.
   * Changed the defined key-length of DES ciphers in cipher.h to include the
     parity bits, to prevent mistakes in copying data. (Closes ticket #33)
   * Loads of minimal changes to better support WINCE as a build target
     (Credits go to Marco Lizza)
   * Added POLARSSL_MPI_WINDOW_SIZE definition to allow easier time to memory
     trade-off
   * Introduced POLARSSL_MPI_MAX_SIZE and POLARSSL_MPI_MAX_BITS for MPI size
     management (Closes ticket #44)
   * Changed the used random function pointer to more flexible format. Renamed
     havege_rand() to havege_random() to prevent mistakes. Lots of changes as
     a consequence in library code and programs
   * Moved all examples programs to use the new entropy and CTR_DRBG
   * Added permissive certificate parsing to x509parse_crt() and
     x509parse_crtfile(). With permissive parsing the parsing does not stop on
     encountering a parse-error. Beware that the meaning of return values has
     changed!
   * All error codes are now negative. Even on mermory failures and IO errors.

Bugfix
   * Fixed faulty HMAC-MD2 implementation. Found by dibac. (Closes
     ticket #37)
   * Fixed a bug where the CRL parser expected an EXPLICIT ASN.1 tag
     before version numbers
   * Allowed X509 key usage parsing to accept 4 byte values instead of the
     standard 1 byte version sometimes used by Microsoft. (Closes ticket #38)
   * Fixed incorrect behaviour in case of RSASSA-PSS with a salt length
     smaller than the hash length. (Closes ticket #41)
   * If certificate serial is longer than 32 octets, serial number is now
     appended with '....' after first 28 octets
   * Improved build support for s390x and sparc64 in bignum.h
   * Fixed MS Visual C++ name clash with int64 in sha4.h
   * Corrected removal of leading "00:" in printing serial numbers in
     certificates and CRLs

= Version 1.0.0 released on 2011-07-27
Features
   * Expanded cipher layer with support for CFB128 and CTR mode
   * Added rsa_encrypt and rsa_decrypt simple example programs.

Changes
   * The generic cipher and message digest layer now have normal error
     codes instead of integers

Bugfix
   * Undid faulty bug fix in ssl_write() when flushing old data (Ticket
     #18)

= Version 0.99-pre5 released on 2011-05-26
Features
   * Added additional Cipher Block Modes to symmetric ciphers
     (AES CTR, Camellia CTR, XTEA CBC) including the option to
     enable and disable individual modes when needed
   * Functions requiring File System functions can now be disabled
     by undefining POLARSSL_FS_IO
   * A error_strerror function() has been added to translate between
     error codes and their description.
   * Added mpi_get_bit() and mpi_set_bit() individual bit setter/getter
     functions.
   * Added ssl_mail_client and ssl_fork_server as example programs.

Changes
   * Major argument / variable rewrite. Introduced use of size_t
     instead of int for buffer lengths and loop variables for
     better unsigned / signed use. Renamed internal bigint types
     t_int and t_dbl to t_uint and t_udbl in the process
   * mpi_init() and mpi_free() now only accept a single MPI
     argument and do not accept variable argument lists anymore.
   * The error codes have been remapped and combining error codes
     is now done with a PLUS instead of an OR as error codes
     used are negative.
   * Changed behaviour of net_read(), ssl_fetch_input() and ssl_recv().
     net_recv() now returns 0 on EOF instead of
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_CONN_RESET. ssl_fetch_input() returns
     POLARSSL_ERR_SSL_CONN_EOF on an EOF from its f_recv() function.
     ssl_read() returns 0 if a POLARSSL_ERR_SSL_CONN_EOF is received
     after the handshake.
   * Network functions now return POLARSSL_ERR_NET_WANT_READ or
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_WANT_WRITE instead of the ambiguous
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_TRY_AGAIN

= Version 0.99-pre4 released on 2011-04-01
Features
   * Added support for PKCS#1 v2.1 encoding and thus support
     for the RSAES-OAEP and RSASSA-PSS operations.
   * Reading of Public Key files incorporated into default x509
     functionality as well.
   * Added mpi_fill_random() for centralized filling of big numbers
     with random data (Fixed ticket #10)

Changes
   * Debug print of MPI now removes leading zero octets and
     displays actual bit size of the value.
   * x509parse_key() (and as a consequence x509parse_keyfile())
     does not zeroize memory in advance anymore. Use rsa_init()
     before parsing a key or keyfile!

Bugfix
   * Debug output of MPI's now the same independent of underlying
     platform (32-bit / 64-bit) (Fixes ticket #19, found by Mads
     Kiilerich and Mihai Militaru)
   * Fixed bug in ssl_write() when flushing old data (Fixed ticket
     #18, found by Nikolay Epifanov)
   * Fixed proper handling of RSASSA-PSS verification with variable
     length salt lengths

= Version 0.99-pre3 released on 2011-02-28

     are now supported as well (Fixes ticket #5)
   * Added crl_app program to allow easy reading and
     printing of X509 CRLs from file

Changes
   * Parsing of PEM files moved to separate module (Fixes
     ticket #13). Also possible to remove PEM support for
     systems only using DER encoding

Bugfixes
   * Corrected parsing of UTCTime dates before 1990 and
     after 1950

     (found by Mads Kiilerich)
   * Support more exotic name representations when parsing
     certificates (found by Mads Kiilerich)
   * Replaced the expired test certificates
   * Do not bail out if no client certificate specified. Try
     to negotiate anonymous connection (Fixes ticket #12,
     found by Boris Krasnovskiy)

Security fixes
   * Fixed a possible Man-in-the-Middle attack on the
     Diffie Hellman key exchange (thanks to Larry Highsmith,
     Subreption LLC)

Changes
   * x509parse_time_expired() checks time in addition to
     the existing date check
   * The ciphers member of ssl_context and the cipher member
     of ssl_session have been renamed to ciphersuites and

     with the generic cipher layer and is better naming
     altogether
