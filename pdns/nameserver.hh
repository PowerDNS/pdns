/** This is the main class. It opens a socket on udp port 53 and waits for packets. Those packets can 
    be retrieved with the receive() member function, which returns a DNSPacket.

    Some sample code in main():
    \code
    typedef Distributor<DNSPacket,DNSPacket,PacketHandler> DNSDistributor;
    DNSDistributor D(6); // the big dispatcher!
    
    pthread_t qtid, atid;
    N=new UDPNameserver;
    
    pthread_create(&qtid,0,qthread,static_cast<void *>(&D)); // receives packets
    pthread_create(&atid,0,athread,static_cast<void *>(&D)); // sends packets
    \endcode

    Code for qthread:
    \code
    void *qthread(void *p)
    {
      DNSDistributor *D=static_cast<DNSDistributor *>(p);
    
      DNSPacket *P;
    
      while((P=N->receive())) // receive a packet
      {
         D->question(P); // and give to the distributor, they will delete it
      }
      return 0;
    }

    \endcode
