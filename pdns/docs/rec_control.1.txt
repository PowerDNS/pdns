	important server has a new IP address, but the TTL has not yet
	expired. Multiple domain names can be passed. Note that you must
	terminate a domain with a .!  So to wipe powerdns.org, issue
	'rec_control wipe-cache powerdns.org.'.
	Versions beyond 3.1 don't need the trailing dot. Consider not only
	wiping 'www.domain.com.' but also 'domain.com.', as the cached nameservers
	or target of CNAME may continue to be undesired.
