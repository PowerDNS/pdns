NAME
----
dnstcpbench - tool to perform TCP benchmarking of nameservers

SYNOPSIS
--------
'dnstcpbench' [--help] [--verbose] [--udp-first, -u] [--workers] [--timeout-msec] remote-ip-address [remote-port]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
dnstcpbench reads DNS queries from standard input and sends them out in
parallel to a remote nameserver. By default TCP/IP is used, but optionally,
UDP is tried first, which allows for the benchmarking of TCP/IP fallback.

The input format is one query per line: qname single-space qtype. An
example:
	www.powerdns.com ANY
	powerdns.com MX

When benchmarking extended runs, it may be necessary to enable TIME_WAIT
recycling, as TCP/IP port tuples may otherwise run out.  On Linux this is
performed by running:

   # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle 

OPTIONS
-------

--verbose::
	Be wordy on what the program is doing

--udp-first, -u::
	Attempt resolution via UDP first, only do TCP if truncated answer is
	received

--workers::
	Number of parallel worker threads to use. 

--timeout-msec::
	Number of milliseconds to wait for an answer	

--help::
	Provide a helpful message

BUGS
----
Currently the timeout code does not actually perform non-blocking connects
or writes.  So a slow connect or slow writes will still cause low
performance and delays. 

Does not yet support IPv6 testing.
