This document describes what Global Server Load Balancing is, and how
PowerDNS can be employed in a GSLB configuration
</abstract>
<toc>
<sect>GSLB
<p>
GSLB, short for Global Server Load Balancing, isr the act of distributing
server traffic to different locations. Although not necessary, this is
almost always done using a smart nameserver.
<sect1>Typical GSLB implementation
<p>
A user enters the name of a site ('www.thesite.com') in his or her browser.
This causes the operating system, often Windows, to send out a request to
the ISP of the user, asking for the IP address of www.thesite.com. If the
nameserver of the ISP doesn't know this address, it asks the nameserver of
thesite.com.
<p>
This nameserver then contains the GSLB smartness. Based on the IP Address of
the nameserver of the ISP, it determines which of the 'www.thesite.com'
servers is closest.

A multitude of algoritms is in use for determining which server is closest.
Some of them employ the Border Gateway Protocol, BGP, which is used for
global internet routing. Some use 'ICMP Ping' measurements, some use
modified DNS Queries. The simplest algorithm is to use IP Netmasks, which
are an easy rule of thumb for determining who assigned an IP Address, which
also gives it probable location.

<sect>IP Netmasks and Location
<p>
IP Addresses are asigned by only a few entities worldwide, the foremost
being ARIN, RIPE and APNIC, who respectively manage North- and South
America, Europe and surrounding areas, and the Asian Pacific Region.

This allows for coarse grained identification of location. While not very
precise, it is very robust and guaranteed to work. It can be likened to a
very good rule-of-thumb. Other methods employ complicated and fragile
techniques for determining the 'internet distance' to a site.

For example, ICMP Ping measurements are becoming less and less valid. The
advent of Distributed Denial of Service attacks has lead many internet
providers to block or limit these packets. The aforementioned BGP router
protocol gives distance in 'AS Hops' which are no longer a valid measure of
distance, as many Autonomous Subsystems now spread the globe.

<sect1>IP Netmasks Configuration
<p>
PowerDNS comes preconfigured with a reasonable set of IP Rules. These may
need some maintainance over time. It is adviseable to get a Subscription with
PowerDNS so as to receive updates.

These rules come in several levels. The lowest level is based on who
assigned the IP Addresses, ARIN, RIPE or APNIC. The second level contains
exceptions to these major rules. Change is expected especially in this
second level.

<sect>GSLB Concepts
<p>
A number of concepts are used in the PowerDNS GSLB configuration:

<descrip>
<tag>Netblock</tag>
A netblock is a range of IP Addresses. A number of Netblocks together are
grouped in a Region.
<tag>Region</tag>
A Region might be called 'ARIN' or 'Surfnet', and consists of a limited
number of Netmasks.
<tag>Target</tag>
A Target describes a set of servers in a single location. Target names might
be 'UUnet Amsterdam', 'Level3 Amsterdam' or 'Genuity'.
<tag>Route</tag>
A Route assigns a certain Region to a Target. A sample Route might be:
Assign all ARIN IP Addresses to Genuity.
<tag>Schema</tag>
A set of Routes, Regions, Netblocks and Targets is called a Schema. Many
different domains may be assigned to this Schema, which then only needs to
be defined once.
</descrip>

<sect>DNS Configuration
<p>
In order to Load Balance a domain it must be pointed at the GSLB Schema.
This is typically done using a DNS CNAME on the nameserver of the domain
that needs to be balanced.

In order for this to work, the Schema name must resolve to the IP Address of
PowerDNS.
