# Virtual Hosting
It may be advantageous to run multiple separate PDNS installations on a single host, for example to make sure that different customers cannot affect each others zones. PDNS fully supports running multiple instances on one host.

To generate additional PDNS instances, copy the init.d script `pdns` to `pdns-name`, where `name` is the name of your virtual configuration. Must not contain a - as this will confuse the script.

When you launch PDNS via this renamed script, it will seek configuration instructions not in `pdns.conf` but in `pdns-name.conf`, allowing for separate specification of parameters.

**Warning**: Be aware however that the init.d `force-stop` will kill all PDNS instances!
