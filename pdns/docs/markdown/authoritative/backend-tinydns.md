# TinyDNS Backend
**Warning**: The TinyDNS Backend is available since PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.1. This backend is marked as experimental!

* Native: Yes
* Master: Yes
* Slave: No
* Superslave: No
* Autoserial: No
* DNSSEC: No
* Multiple Instances: Yes
* Module name: tinydns
* Launch: tinydns

The TinyDNS backend allows you to use [djbdns's](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html) `data.cdb` file format as the storage of your DNS records. The `data.cdb` file is created using [tinydns-data](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns-data.html). The backend is designed to be able to use the `data.cdb` files without any changes.

## Configuration Parameters
These are the configuration file parameters that are available for the TinyDNS backend. It is recommended to set the `tinydns-dbfile`.

### `tinydns-dbfile`
* String
* Default: data.cdb
Specifies the name of the data file to use.

### `tinydns-tai-adjust`
* Integer
* Default: 11
This adjusts the [TAI](http://www.tai64.com/) value if timestamps are used. These seconds will be added to the start point (1970) and will allow you to adjust for leap seconds. The current default is 11. The last update was on [june 30th 2012](http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat).

### `tinydns-notify-on-startup`
* Boolean
* Default: no
Tell the TinyDNSBackend to notify all the slave nameservers on startup. This might cause broadcast storms.

### `tinydns-ignore-bogus-records`
* Boolean
* Default: no
The `tinydns-data` program can create data.cdb files that have bad/corrupt RDATA. PowerDNS will crash when it tries to read that bad/corrupt data. This option (change to yes), allows you to ignore that bad RDATA to make PowerDNS operate when bad data is in your CDB file. Be aware that the records are then ignored, where tinydns would still send out the bogus data. The option is primarily useful in master mode, as that reads all the packets in the zone to find all the SOA records.

### `tinydns-locations`
* Boolean
* Default: no
Enable or Disable location support in the backend. Changing the value to 'no' will make the backend ignore the locations. This then returns all records. When the setting is changed to 'no' an AXFR will also return all the records. With the setting on 'yes' an AXFR will only return records without a location.

## Location and Timestamp support
Both timestamp and location are supported in the backend. Locations support can be changed using the [`tinydns-locations`](#tinydns-locations) setting. Timestamp and location only work as expected when [`cache-ttl`](settings.md#cache-ttl) and [`query-cache-ttl`](settings.md#query-cache-ttl) are set to 0 (which disables these caches). Timestamp can operate with [`cache-ttl`](settings.md#cache-ttl) if cache is needed, but the TTL returned for the timestamped racked will not be totally correct. The record will expire once the cache is expired and the backend is queried again. Please note that [`cache-ttl`](settings.md#cache-ttl) is a performance related setting. See [Performance related settings](performance.md). Location support only exists for IPv4!

##Â Master mode
The TinyDNSBackend supports master mode. This allows it to notify slave nameservers of updates to a zone. You simply need to rewrite the `data.cdb` file with an updated/increased serial and PowerDNS will notify the slave nameservers of that domain. The [`tinydns-notify-on-startup`](#tinydns-notify-on-startup) configuration setting tells the backend if it should notify all the slave nameservers just after startup.

The CDB datafile does not allow PowerDNS to easily query for newly added domains or updated serial numbers. The CDB datafile requires us to do a full scan of all the records. When running with verbose logging, this could lead to a lot of output. The scanning of the CDB file may also take a while on systems with large files. The scan happens at an interval set by the [`slave-cycle-interval`](settings.md#slave-cycle-interval). It might be useful to raise this value to limit the amount of scans on the CDB file.

The TinyDNSBackend also keeps a list of all the zones. This is needed to detect an updated serial and to give every zone a unique id. The list is updated when a zone is added, but not when a zone is removed. This leads to some memory loss.

## Useful implementation Notes
This backend might solve some issues you have with the current tinydns noted on [Jonathan de Boyne Pollard's](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/author.html) [djbdns known problems page](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html).

The `data.cdb` file format support all types of records. They are sometimes difficult to create because you need to specify the actual content of the rdata. [Tinydns.org](http://tinydns.org/) provides a number of links to tools/cgi-scripts that allow you to create records. [Anders Brownworth](http://anders.com/) also provides a number of useful record building scripts on his [djbdnsRecordBuilder](http://anders.com/projects/sysadmin/djbdnsRecordBuilder/).

Compiling the TinyDNS backend requires you to have [tinycdb](http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html) version 0.77.
