    <title>The PowerDNS dynamic nameserver</title>

    <para>
      The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number
      of backends. These backends can either be <link linkend="bindbackend">plain zone files</link> or be 
      <link linkend="pipebackend">more dynamic</link> in nature. Additionally, through use of clever programming techniques,
      PowerDNS offers very high domain resolution performance.
    </para>
    <para>
      Prime examples of backends include relational databases, but also (geographical) load balancing and failover algorithms. 
    </para>
    <para>
      The company is called PowerDNS.COM BV, the nameserver daemon is called PDNS.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="function-design"><title>Function &amp; design of PDNS</title>
      <para>
	PowerDNS consists of two parts: the Authoritative Server and the Recursor. Other nameservers
	fully combine these functions, PowerDNS offers them separately, but can mix both authoritative and recursive
	usage seamlessly.
	
	The Authoritative Server will answer questions about domains it knows about, 
	but will not go out on the net to resolve queries about other domains. However, it can use a 
	<link linkend="recursion">recursing backend</link> to provide that functionality. Depending 
	on your needs, this backend can either be the PowerDNS recursor or an external one.
      </para>
      <para>
	When the Authoritative Server answers a question, it comes out of the database, and can be trusted as being authoritative. There is
	no way to pollute the cache or to confuse the daemon. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The Recursor, conversely, by default has no knowledge of domains itself, but will always consult other authoritative servers
	to answer questions given to it.
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS has been designed to serve both the needs of small installations by being easy to setup, as well as 
	for serving very large query volumes on large numbers of domains.
      </para>
      <para>
	Another prime goal is <link linkend="security">security</link>. By the use of language features, the PDNS source code 
	is very small (in the order of  10.000 lines) which makes auditing easy. In the same way, library features have been used 
	to mitigate the risks of buffer overflows.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, PDNS is able to give a lot of <link linkend="monitoring">statistics</link> on its operation which is both helpful in 
	determining the scalability of an installation as well as for spotting problems.

      <para>
      	This is a stability and confirmity update to 3.1. It mostly makes our DNSSEC implementation more robust,
      	and improves interoperability with various validators.
      </para>
      <para>
      	DNSSEC changes in 3.2:
      	<itemizedlist>
  		<listitem>
  			<para>
      			Kees Monshouwer did a tremendous amount of work to improve and perfect our DNSSEC implementation,
      			mostly in the NSEC3 area. Code in c2687, c2689, c2691, fixing t486, t537, t540. He also implemented support for Empty Non-Terminals,
      			code in c2721, c2732, c2745, fixing t127 and t558.
      		</para>
  		</listitem>
  		<listitem>
  			<para>
  				Presigned wildcard operation was improved with the help of many parties (see commit message for c2676). Presigned operation
  				was also changed to be more consistent with master/live-signing operation. Code and a full test suite in c2709, which also improves
  				TTL behaviour for various situations. Fixes t460, t533, t559.
  			</para>
  		</listitem>
  		<listitem>
  			<para>
  				Depending on database &amp; locale settings, names starting with underscore would sometimes cause broken records. c2710 contains schema
  				and code changes for the gpgsql and gmysql backends to sort this (no pun intended) definitively, closing t550. In addition, a pdnssec test-schema command was added (experimental and incomplete). It can be used to verify underscore sorting and a few other parameters of the database. Code in c2714.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				We now always include an EDNS section in responses to queries that also had an EDNS section. This was thought to improve BIND interoperability, but this turned out to be false. In any case, this change improves standards compliance. Spotted by Mats Dufberg, code in c2649.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				It turns out we were storing Botan keys the wrong way. Botan did not care but Polar did, causing interoperability problems. Fixed in c2720, with the kind help of Paul Bakker of PolarSSL. Fixes t492 as reported by Florian Obser via Debian.
			</para>
		</listitem>
  		<listitem>
  			<para>
  				pdnssec add-zone-key now defaults to RSASHA256, like secure-zone already did. Code in c2692.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				pdns_control purge now also purges DNSSEC-related caches (keys and metadata). Code in c2694, by Ruben d'Arco. Fixes t530.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				The signer thread would die in specific situations, leaving you with a non-working but very busy system. Fixed in c2668, c2670, closing t517.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		Non-DNSSEC improvements/changes in 3.2:
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				A new backend, the 'Remote backend' <xref linkend="remotebackend" /> was submitted by Aki Tuomi. It aims to replace the pipebackend with a better protocol and support for more connection methods, including HTTP. Code in c2755, c2756, c2757, c2758, c2759, closing t529.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				The gsqlite (SQLite 2) backend was removed. We were not aware of any users and it was not actually working anyway. Changes in c2773-c2777, closing t565.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Various tinydnsbackend improvements: ignore-bogus-records option; TAI offset updated; strip dots on names where suitable; various internal improvements. Code in c2762.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				gpgsql no longer logs the database password in connection errors. Code in c2609, c2612, closing t459.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				You can now finally specify 0.0.0.0 or :: as local-address/local-ipv6 without getting replies from the wrong address. This much-requested feature is implemented in c2763, c2766, c2779 and c2781. Tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
			</para>
		</listitem>
  		<listitem>
  			<para>
  				3.2 can be reliably built with or without Lua. This and many other configure/compile-related fixes in c2610, c2611 (t461), c2666, c2671, c2672 (t522), c2673 (t522), c2696 (t555), c2697 (t457), c2698, c2708, c2742 (t462), c2752 (t437), c2764.

			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Ruben d'Arco submitted various improvements regarding trailing dots. Additional lookups now try harder, pdnssec errors about trailing dots in names, pdnssec warns about trailing dots in names inside content fields, AXFR now strips the dot from SRV hostnames. Code in c2748, fixes t289.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Pre-3.0, backends would get cycled if they threw the right error. 3.2 reinstates this behaviour, as it is more robust. Change in c2734 (reverting c2100), fixes t386.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				PowerDNS auth does not use the select() kernel/library call anymore. This means fd-numbers over 1023 (and, in general, more than 1024 sockets, including more than 1024 listening sockets) should now work reliably. Code in c2739, c2740, fixes t408.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				gmysql users can now specify the 'group' we connect as, using the gmysql-group setting. Submitted by Kees Monshouwer, code in c2770, c2771, c2778, c2780, closing t463.
			</para>

			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				We would sometimes serve stale data after an incoming AXFR. Reported by Martin Draschl, fixed by Ruben d'Arco in c2699, closing t525.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			Duplicate incoming NOTIFYs could cause PowerDNS to try to insert the same domain name into a database twice. Fixed in c2703, closing t453.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				pdnssec show-zone now works on a zone that has any number of keys, instead of requiring active keys. Reported by Jeroen Tushuizen of myH2Oservers, code in c2769, closes t586.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>

      <para>
	Version 3.1 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server represents the 'coming of age' of our DNSSEC implementation. 
	In addition, 3.1 solves a lot of '.0' issues typically associated with a major new release.
      </para>
      <para>
	As usual, we are very grateful for the involvement of the PowerDNS community. The uptake of 3.0
	was rapid, and many users were very helpful in shaking out the bugs, and willing to test the fixes we provided or, in many cases,
	provided the fixes themselves.
      </para>
      <para>
	Of specific note is the giant PowerDNS DNSSEC deployment in Sweden by Atomia and Binero. PowerDNS 3.0 now powers
	over 150000 DNSSEC domains in Sweden, around 95% of all DNSSEC domains, in a country were most internet service 
	providers actually validate all .SE domains.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, this release has benefited a lot from Peter van Dijk joining us, as he has merged a tremendous amount of patches,
	cleaned up years of accumulated dust in the code, and massively improved our regression testing into a full blown continuous integration setup 
	with full DNSSEC tests!
      </para>

	Version 3.0 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server brings a number of important features, as
	well as over two years of accumulated bug fixing.
      </para>
      <para>
	The largest news in 3.0 is of course the advent of DNSSEC. Not only does PowerDNS now (finally)
	support DNSSEC, we think that our support of this important protocol is among the easiest to use available. 
	In addition, all important algorithms are supported.
      </para>
      <para>
	Complete detail can be found in <xref linkend="powerdnssec-auth"/>. The goal of 'PowerDNSSEC' is to allow
	existing PowerDNS installations to start serving DNSSEC with as little hassle as possible,
	while maintaining performance and achieving high levels of security.
      </para>
      <para>
	Tutorials and examples of how to use DNSSEC in PowerDNS can be found linked from <ulink url="http://powerdnssec.org"/>.

	      Lua scripts from version 3.1.7.* are fully compatible with version 3.2. However, scripts written for development snapshot releases, are NOT.
	      Please see <xref linkend="recursor-scripting"/> for details!
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The 3.2 release is the first major release of the PowerDNS Recursor in a long time. Partly this is because 3.1.7.* functioned very well,
	  and delivered satisfying performance, partly this is because in order to really move forward, some heavy lifting had to be done.
	</para>
	<para>
	  As always, we are grateful for the large PowerDNS community that is actively involved in improving the quality of our software, be it by submitting
	  patches, by testing development versions of our software or helping debug interesting issues. We specifically want to thank Stefan Schmidt and Florian Weimer, 
	  who both over the years have helped tremendously in keeping PowerDNS fast, stable and secure.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This version of the PowerDNS Recursor contains a rather novel form of lock-free multithreading, a situation that comes close to the old '--fork' trick,
	  but allows the Recursor to fully utilize multiple CPUs, while delivering unified statistics and operational control.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In effect, this delivers the best of both worlds: near linear scaling, with almost no administrative overhead.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Compared to 'regular multithreading', whereby threads cooperate more closely, more memory is used, since each thread maintains its own DNS cache. 
	  However, given the economics, and the relatively limited total amount of memory needed for high performance, this price is well worth it.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In practical numbers, over 40,000 queries/second sustained performance has now been measured by a third party, with a 100.0% packet response rate. This means that the needs
	  of around 400,000 residential connections can now be met by a single commodity server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition to the above, the PowerDNS Recursor is now providing resolver service for many more Internet users than ever before. This has brought with it 
	  24/7 Service Level Agreements, and 24/7 operational monitoring by networking personnel at some of the largest telecommunications companies in the world.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order to facilitate such operation, more statistics are now provided that allow the visual verification of proper PowerDNS Recursor operation. As an example of this
	  there are now graphs that plot how many queries were dropped by the operating system because of a CPU overload, plus statistics that can be monitored to determine
	  if the PowerDNS deployment is under a spoofing attack.
	</para>
	<para>
	  All in all, this is a large and important PowerDNS Release, paving the way for further innovation.
	</para>
	<para>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    This release removes support for the 'fork' multi-processor option. In addition, the default is now to spawn two threads. This has been done
	    in such a way that total memory usage will remain identical, so each thread will use half of the allocated maximum number of cache entries.

	  Released on the 6th of August 2008.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This release consists of a single patch to PowerDNS Authoritative Server version 2.9.21. 
	  Brian J. Dowling of Simplicity Communications has discovered a security implication of 
	  the previous PowerDNS behaviour to drop queries it considers malformed. We are grateful that
	  Brian notified us quickly about this problem.

	  <xref linkend="powerdns-advisory-2008-02"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The implication is that while the PowerDNS Authoritative server itself does not face a security risk because
	  of dropping these malformed queries, other resolving nameservers run a higher risk of accepting spoofed
	  answers for domains being hosted by PowerDNS Authoritative Servers before 2.9.21.1.

	  While the dropping of queries does not aid sophisticated spoofing attempts, it does facilitate simpler attacks.

	  This version contains powerful scripting abilities, allowing operators to modify DNS responses in many

	<para>

	  This version fixes two important problems, each on its own important enough to justify a quick upgrade.
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Version 3.1.5 had problems resolving several slightly misconfigured domains, including for a time 'juniper.net'. Nameserver timeouts were not being 
	      processed correctly, leading PowerDNS to not update the internal clock, which in turn meant
	      that any queries immediately following an error would time out as well. Because of retries, this would usually not be a problem except on very busy servers, 
	      for domains with different nameservers at different levels of the DNS-hierarchy, like 'juniper.net'.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      This issue was fixed rapidly because of the help of <ulink url="http://www.xs4all.nl">XS4ALL</ulink> (Eric Veldhuyzen, Kai Storbeck),

	      The new high-quality random generator was not used for all random numbers, especially in source port selection. This means that 3.1.5 is still

	<para>
	  Released on the 31st of March 2008.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Much like 3.1.4, this release does not add a lot of major features. Instead, performance has been improved significantly (estimated at around 20%), and many rare
	  and not so rare issues were addressed. Multi-part TXT records now work as expected - the only significant functional bug found in 15 months. One of the oldest
	  feature requests was fulfilled: version 3.1.5 can finally forward queries for designated domains to multiple servers, on differing port numbers if needed. 
	  Previously only one forwarder address was supported. This lack held back a number of migrations to PowerDNS.

	<para>
	  Released the 21st of April 2007.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This is the first release the PowerDNS Authoritative Server since the Recursor was split off to a separate product, and also marks the transfer
	  of the new technology developed specifically for the recursor, back to the authoritative server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This move has reduced the amount of code of the Authoritative server by over 2000 lines, while improving the quality
	  of the program enormously.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, since so much has been changed, care should be taken when deploying 2.9.21.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To signify the magnitude of the underlying improvements, the next release of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server will be called 3.0.
	</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The previous packet parsing and generating code contained no known bugs, but was however very lengthy and overly complex, and might have had
		security problems. The new code is 'inherently safe' because it relies on bounds-checking C++ constructs. Therefore, a move to 2.9.21 is highly
		recommended.

		but it has been observed by 'Cerb' on #powerdns. Several dead-locks where PowerDNS consumed all CPU, but did not answer questions, 
		have been reported in the past few months. These might be fixed by c904.

	<para>
	  Released the 12th of September 2006.

	  Many thanks are again due to Darren Gamble who together with his team has discovered many misconfigured domains that do work 
	  with some other name servers. DNS has long been tolerant of misconfigurations, PowerDNS intends to uphold that tradition. Almost all of
	  the domains found by Darren now work as well in PowerDNS as in other name server implementations.

	  Thanks to some recent migrations, this release, or something very close to it, is powering over 40 million internet connections that
	  we know of. We appreciate hearing about successful as well as unsuccessful migrations, please feel free to notify pdns.bd@powerdns.com of your

		Switch from the excellent nedmalloc to dlmalloc, based on advice by the nedmalloc author. Nedmalloc is optimised for multithreaded
		operation, whereas the PowerDNS recursor is single threaded. The version of nedmalloc shipped contained a number of possible bugs,
		which are probably resolved by moving to dlmalloc. Some reported crashes on hitting 2G of allocated memory on 64 bit systems might 
		be solved by this switch, which should also increase performance. See c873 for details.

	<para>
	  Released Monday 26th of June 2006.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Compared to 3.1.1, this release consists almost exclusively of bug-fixes and speedups. A quick update is recommended, as some of the bugs
	  impact operators of authoritative zones on the internet. This version has been tested by some of the largest internet providers on the planet,
	  and is expected to perform well for everybody.

	      <para>
		Internal authoritative server did not differentiate between 'NXDOMAIN' and 'NXRRSET', in other words, it would answer
		'no such host' when an AAAA query came in for a domain that did exist, but did not have an AAAA record. This only affects
		users with <command>auth-zones</command> configured. Discovered by Bryan Seitz, fixed in c848.

	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		ANY queries for hosts where nothing was present in the cache would not work. This did not cause real problems as ANY queries are 
		not reliable (by design) for anything other than debugging, but did slow down the nameserver and cause unnecessary load on remote
		nameservers. Fixed in c854.

	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		When exceeding the configured maximum amount of TCP sessions, TCP support would break and the nameserver would waste CPU trying to accept TCP

	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		DNS queries come in two flavours: recursion desired and non-recursion desired. The latter is not very useful for a recursor, but is 
		sometimes (erroneously) used by monitoring software or load balancers to detect nameserver availability. A non-rd query would not only not recurse,
		but also not query authoritative zones, which is confusing. Fixed in c847.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Non-standard DNS TCP queries, that did occur however, could drive the recursor to 100% CPU usage for extended periods of time. This did not disrupt service
		immediately, but does waste a lot of CPU, possibly exhausting resources. Discovered by Bryan Seitz, fixed in c858, which is post-3.1.2-rc1.

	      3.1.1 is identical to 3.1 except for a bug in the packet chaining code which would mainly manifest itself for IPv6 enabled Konqueror

	<para>
	  Released 20th of April 2006, <ulink url="http://www.powerdns.com/en/downloads.aspx">download</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This is the first separate release of the PowerDNS Recursor. There are many reasons for this, one of the most important ones is that 
	  previously we could only do a release when both the recursor and the authoritative nameserver were fully tested and in good shape. The split
	  allows us to release new versions when each part is ready.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Now for the real news. This version of the PowerDNS recursor powers the network access of over two million internet connections. Two large
	  access providers have been running pre-releases of 3.0 for the past few weeks and results are good. Furthermore, the various pre-releases
	  have been tested nearly non-stop with DNS traffic replayed at 3000 queries/second.
	</para>
	<para>
	  As expected, the 2 million households shook out some very rare bugs. But even a rare bug happens once in a while when there are this many users.
	</para>
	<para>
	  We consider this version of the PowerDNS recursor to be the most advanced resolver publicly available. Given current levels of spam, phishing 
	  and other forms of internet crime we think no recursor should offer less than the best in spoofing protection. We urge all 
	  operators of resolvers without proper spoofing countermeasures to consider PowerDNS, as it is a Better Internet Nameserver Daemon.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A good article on DNS spoofing can be found <ulink url="http://www.securesphere.net/download/papers/dnsspoof.htm">here</ulink>. Some 
	  more information, based on a previous version of PowerDNS, can be found on the 
	  <ulink url="http://blog.netherlabs.nl/articles/2006/04/14/holy-cow-1-3-million-additional-ip-addresses-served-by-powerdns">PowerDNS development blog</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Because of recent DNS based denial of service attacks, running an open recursor has become a security risk. Therefore, unless configured otherwise
	      this version of PowerDNS will only listen on localhost, which means it does not resolve for hosts on your network.
	      To fix, configure the <command>local-address</command> setting with all addresses you want to listen on. Additionally, by default
	      service is restricted to RFC 1918 private IP addresses. Use <command>allow-from</command> to selectively open up the recursor
	      for your own network. See <xref linkend="recursor-settings"/> for details.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-19"><title>Version 2.9.19</title>
	<para>
	  Released 29th of October 2005.
	</para>
	<para>
	  As with other recent releases, the usage of PowerDNS appears to have skyrocketed. Informal, though strict, measurements show
	  that PowerDNS now powers around 50% of all German domains, and somewhere in the order of 10-15% of the rest of the world. Furthermore,
	  DNS is set to take a central role in connecting Voice over IP providers, with PowerDNS offering a very good feature set for these ENUM
	  deployments. PowerDNS is already powering the E164.info ENUM zone and also acts as the backend for a major VoIP provisioning platform.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Included in this release is the now complete packet parsing/generating, record parsing/generating infrastructure. Furthermore,
	  this framework is used by the recursor, hopefully making it very fast, memory efficient and robust. Many records are now processed
	  using a single line of code. This has made the recursor a lot stricter in packet parsing, you will see some error messages
	  which did not appear before. Rest assured however that these only happen for queries which have no valid answer in any case.
	</para>
	<para> 
	  Furthermore, support for DNSSEC records is available in the new infrastructure, although is should be emphasised that there is more
	  to DNSSEC than parsing records. There is no real support for DNSSEC (yet).
	</para>
	<para>
	  Additionally, the BIND Backend has been replaced by what was up to now known as the 'Bind2Backend'. Initial benchmarking appears
	  to show that this backend is faster, uses less memory and has shorter startup times. The code is also shorter.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This release fixes a number of embarrassing bugs and is a recommended upgrade. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  Thanks are due to <ulink url="http://www.xs4all.nl">XS4ALL</ulink> who are supporting continuing development of PowerDNS,

	  Currently several big ISPs are evaluating the PowerDNS recursor for their resolving needs, some of them have switched already.
	  In the course of testing, over 350 million actual queries have been recorded and replayed, the answers turn out to be satisfactorily.

	      There appears to be a problem with PowerDNS on Red Hat 7.3 with GCC 2.96 and self-compiled binaries. The symptoms are
	      that PowerDNS works on the foreground but fails as a daemon. We're working on it.

	  There have been a number of reports on MySQL connections being dropped on FreeBSD 4.x, which sometimes causes PowerDNS to give up and reload itself. 
	  To combat this, MySQL error messages have been improved in some places in hopes of figuring out what is up. The initial indication is 
	  that MySQL itself sometimes terminates the connection and, amazingly, that switching to a Unix domain socket instead of TCP solves
	  the problem.

	  This is a sweeping release in the sense of cleanup. There are some new features but mostly a lot of cleanup going on. Hiding inside is the 
	  <filename>bind2backend</filename>, the next generation of the bind backend. A work in progress. Those of you with overlapping zones,
	  as mentioned in the changelog of 2.9.6, are invited to check it out by replacing <command>launch=bind</command>
	  by <command>launch=bind2</command> and renaming all <command>bind-</command> parameters to
	  <command>bind2-</command>. Be aware that if you run with many small zones, this backend is faster, but if you run with a few large ones, it is slower. This will improve.

	<para>
	  Two new backends - Generic ODBC (windows only) and LDAP. Furthermore, a few important bugs have been fixed which may have hampered sites seeing a lot of 
	  outgoing zone transfers. Additionally, the pdns recursor now has 'query throttling' which is pretty cool. In short this makes sure that PowerDNS 
	  does not send out heaps of queries if a nameserver is unable to provide an answer. Many operators of authoritative setups are all too aware of 
	  recursing nameservers that hammer them for zones they don't have, PowerDNS won't do that anymore now, no matter what clients request of it.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-5"><title>Version 2.9.5</title>	
	<para>
	  Released on 2002-02-03.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This version is almost entirely about recursion with major changes to both the pdns recursor, which is renamed to 
	  '<filename>pdns_recursor</filename>' and to the main PowerDNS binary to make it interact better with the recursing component.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Sadly, due to <ulink url="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2003-01/msg00245.html">technical reasons</ulink>, compiling
	  the pdns recursor and pdns authoritative nameserver into one binary is not immediately possible. During the release of 2.9.4 we
	  stated that the recursing nameserver would be integrated in the next release - this won't happen now.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, this turns out to not be that bad at all. The recursor can now be restarted without having to restart the rest of the nameserver,
	  for example. Cooperation between the both halves of PDNS is also almost seamless. As a result, 'non-lazy recursion' has been dropped. See
	  <xref linkend="recursion"/> for more details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Furthermore, the recursor only works on Linux, Windows and Solaris (not entirely). FreeBSD does not support the required functions.
	  If you know any important FreeBSD people, plea with them to support set/get/swapcontext! Alternatively, FreeBSD coders could read
	  the solution presented here <ulink url="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~ejones/software/threading.html">in figure 5</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The 'Contributor of the Month' award goes to Mark Bergsma who has responded to our plea for help with the label compressor and contributed
	  a wonderfully simple and right fix that allows PDNS to compress just as well as other nameservers out there. An honorary mention goes to
	  Ueli Heuer who, despite having no C++ experience, submitted an excellent SRV record implementation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Excellent work was also performed by Michel Stol, the Windows guy, in fixing all our non-portable stuff again. Christof Meerwald has also done 
	  wonderful work in porting MTasker to Windows, which was then used by Michel to get the recursor functioning on Windows.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-9-4"><title>Version 2.9.4</title>	
	<para>
	  Yet another grand release. Big news is the addition of a recursing nameserver which has sprung into existence
	  over the past week. It is in use on several computers already but it is not ready for prime time. Complete integration
	  with PowerDNS is expected around 2.9.5, for now the recursor is a separate program. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  In preliminary tests, the recursor appears to be four times faster than BIND 9 on a naive benchmark starting from a cold cache. BIND 9
	  managed to get through to some slower nameservers however, which were given up on by PowerDNS. We will continue to tune the recursor.
	  See <xref linkend="built-in-recursor"/> for further details.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The BIND Backend has also been tested (see the <command>bind-domain-status</command> item below) rather heavily by several parties. After some
	  discussion online, one of the BIND authors ventured that the newsgroup comp.protocols.dns.bind may now in fact be an appropriate venue
	  for discussing PowerDNS. Since this discussion, traffic to the PowerDNS pages has increased sixfold and shows no signs of slowing down.
	</para>
	<para>
	  From this, it is apparent that far more people are interested in PowerDNS than yet know about it. So spread the word!

	<para>
	  Broad range of huge improvements. We now have an all-static .rpm and .deb for Linux users and a link to an OpenBSD port.
	  Major news is that work on the Bind backend has progressed to the point that we've just retired our last Bind server and 
	  replaced it with PowerDNS in Bind mode! This server is operating a number of master and slave setups so it should stress the Bind backend 
	  somewhat.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This version is rapidly approaching the point where it is a better-Bind-than-Bind and nearly a drop-in replacement for authoritative 
	  setups. PowerDNS is now equipped with a powerful 
	  master/slave apparatus that offers a lot of insight and control to the user, even when operating from Bind zone files and a 
	  Bind configuration. Observe.
	</para>
	<para>
	  After the SOA of ds9a.nl was raised:
	  <screen>
pdns[17495]: All slave domains are fresh
pdns[17495]: 1 domain for which we are master needs notifications
pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3
pdns[17495]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1
pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' initiated by 195.193.163.3
pdns[17520]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 finished
pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' initiated by 213.156.2.1
pdns[17521]: AXFR of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 finished
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: No master domains need notifications
	  </screen>
	  If however our slaves would ignore us, as some are prone to do, we can send some additional notifications:
	  <screen>
$ sudo pdns_control notify ds9a.nl         
Added to queue
pdns[17492]: Notification request for domain 'ds9a.nl' received
pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3
pdns[17492]: Queued notification of domain 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 195.193.163.3 (was acknowledged)
pdns[17495]: Removed from notification list: 'ds9a.nl' to 213.156.2.1 (was acknowledged)
	    </screen>
	  Conversely, if PowerDNS needs to be reminded to retrieve a zone from a master, a command is provided:
           <screen>
$ sudo pdns_control retrieve forfun.net
Added retrieval request for 'forfun.net' from master 212.187.98.67
pdns[17495]: AXFR started for 'forfun.net', transaction started
pdns[17495]: Zone 'forfun.net' (/var/cache/bind/forfun.net) reloaded 
pdns[17495]: AXFR done for 'forfun.net', zone committed
	  </screen>
	  Also, you can force PowerDNS to reload a zone from disk immediately with <command>pdns_control bind-reload-now</command>.
	  All this happens 'live', per your instructions. Without instructions, the right things also happen, but the operator is in charge.
	</para>
	<para>

	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Again some changes in compilation instructions. The hybrid pgmysql backend has been split up into 'gmysql' and 'gpgsql', sharing
	      a common base within the PowerDNS server itself. This means that you can no longer compile 
	      <command>--with-modules="pgmysql" --enable-mysql --enable-pgsql</command> but that you should now use:
	      <command>--with-modules="gmysql gpgsql"</command>. The old launch-names remain available. 
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      If you launch the Generic PgSQL backend as gpgsql2, all parameters will have gpgsql2 as a prefix, for example 
	      <command>gpgsql2-dbname</command>. If launched as gpgsql, the regular names are in effect.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      The pdns_control protocol was changed which means that older pdns_controls cannot talk to 2.9.3. The other way around is
	      broken too. This may lead to problems with automatic upgrade scripts, so pay attention if your daemon is truly restarted.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Also make sure no old pdns_control command is around to confuse things.

	  Bugfixes galore. Solaris porting created some issues on all platforms. Great news is that PowerDNS is now in Debian 'sid' (unstable). The 2.9.1
	  packages in there currently aren't very good but the 2.9.2 ones will be. Many thanks to Wichert Akkerman, our 'downstream' for making this possible.

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-6"><title>Version 2.6</title>
	<para>
	  Performance release. A lot of work has been done to raise PDNS performance to staggering levels in order to take part
	  in benchmarketing efforts. Together with our as yet unnamed partner, PDNS has been benchmarked at 60.000 mostly cached queries/second
	  on off the shelf PC hardware. Uncached performance was 17.000 uncached DNS queries/second on the .ORG domain.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Performance has been increased by both making PDNS itself quicker but also by lowering the number of backend queries typically needed. Operators
	  will typically see PDNS taking less CPU and the backend seeing less load.

	  Furthermore, some real bugs were fixed. A couple of undocumented performance switches may appear in --help output but you are advised to stay

      <sect2 id="changelog-2-5"><title>Version 2.5</title>
	<para>
	  An important release which has seen quite a lot of trial and error testing. As a result, PDNS can now run with a huge cache
	  and concurrent invalidations. This is useful when running of a slower database or under high traffic load with a fast database.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Furthermore, the gpgsql2 backend has been validated for use and will soon supplant the gpgsql backend entirely. This also bodes

	  New features:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Query cache. The old Packet Cache only cached entire questions and their answers. This is very CPU efficient but
		does not lead to maximum hitrate. Two packets both needing to resolve smtp.you.com internally would not benefit 
		from any caching. Furthermore, many different DNS queries lead to the same backend queries, like 'SOA for .COM?'.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		PDNS now also caches backend queries, but only those having no answer (the majority) and those having one answer 
		(almost the rest). 
	      </para>
	      <para>
		In tests, these additional caches appear to halve the database backend load numerically and perhaps even more in terms
		of CPU load. Often, queries with no answer are more expensive than those having one.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The default <command>ttl</command>s for the query-cache and negquery-cache are set to safe values (20 and 60 seconds
		respectively), you should be seeing an improvement in behaviour without sacrificing a lot in terms of quick updates.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The webserver also displays the efficiency of the new Query Cache.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The old Packet Cache is still there (and useful) but see <xref linkend="performance"/> for more details.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		There is now the ability to shut off some logging at a very early stage. High performance sites doing thousands of 
		queries/second may in fact spend most of their CPU time on attempting to write out logging, even though it is ignored
		by syslog. The new flag <command>log-dns-details</command>, on by default, allows the operator to kill most 
		informative-only logging before it takes any cpu.
	      </para>

		Recursive queries are now also cached, but in a separate namespace so non-recursive queries don't get recursed answers and
		vice versa. This should mean way lower database load for sites running with the current default lazy-recursion. Up to now,

	      To run the dynamic version of PDNS, which is needed for backend drivers which are only available in source form, gcc 3.0 is required.

	Version 3.0 of the PowerDNS recursor contains a denial of service bug which can be exploited remotely. This bug, which we believe to only lead to a crash,
	has been fixed in 3.0.1. There are no guarantees however, so an upgrade from 3.0 is highly recommended.
      </para>
      <para>
	All versions of PowerDNS before 2.9.21.1 do not respond to certain queries. This in itself is not a problem, but since the discovery by Dan Kaminsky
	of a new spoofing technique, this silence for queries PowerDNS considers invalid, within a valid domain, allows attackers more chances
	to feed *other* resolvers bad data.
      </para>
      <para>
	All versions of PowerDNS before 2.9.18 contain the following two bugs, which only apply to installations running with the LDAP backend, or installations providing recursion
	to a limited range of IP addresses. If any of these apply to you, an upgrade is highly advised:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The LDAP backend did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to fail and not answer questions. We have not investigated further risks involved,
	      but we advise LDAP users to update as quickly as possible (Norbert Sendetzky, Jan de Groot)
	    </para>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Questions from clients denied recursion could blank out answers to clients who are allowed recursion services, temporarily. Reported by Wilco Baan.
	      This would've made it possible for outsiders to blank out a domain temporarily to your users. Luckily PowerDNS would send out SERVFAIL or Refused, and
	      not a denial of a domain's existence.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	All versions of PowerDNS before 2.9.17 are known to suffer from remote denial of service problems which can disrupt operation. Please upgrade
	to 2.9.17 as this page will only contain detailed security information from 2.9.17 onwards.

	We would like to thank Amit Klein of Trusteer for bringing a serious           
	vulnerability to our attention which would enable a smart attacker to          
	'spoof' previous versions of the PowerDNS Recursor into accepting possibly     
	malicious data.     
      </para>

	This security problem was announced in <ulink url="http://mailman.powerdns.com/pipermail/pdns-users/2008-March/005279.html">this email message</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is recommended that all users of the PowerDNS Recursor upgrade to 3.1.5
	as soon as practicable, while we simultaneously note that busy servers are
	less susceptible to the attack, but not immune.
      </para>
      <para>
	The vulnerability is present on all operating systems where the behaviour      
	of the libc random() function can be predicted based on its past output.     
	This includes at least all known versions of Linux, as well as Microsoft       
	Windows, and probably FreeBSD and Solaris.
      </para>
      <para>
	The magnitude of this vulnerability depends on internal details of the         
	system random() generator. For Linux, the mathematics of the random            
	generator are complex, but well understood and Amit Klein has written and      
	published a proof of concept that can successfully predict its output after     
	uninterrupted observation of 40-50 DNS queries.
      </para>
      <para>
	Because the observation needs to be uninterrupted, busy PowerDNS Recursor      
	instances are harder to subvert - other data is highly likely to be            
	interleaved with traffic generated by an attacker. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Nevertheless, operators are urged to update at their earliest convenience.

	Brian J. Dowling of Simplicity Communications has discovered a security implication of 
	the previous PowerDNS behaviour to drop queries it considers malformed. We are grateful that
	Brian notified us quickly about this problem.
      </para>
      <para>
	The implication is that while the PowerDNS Authoritative server itself does not face a security risk because
	of dropping these malformed queries, other resolving nameservers run a higher risk of accepting spoofed
	answers for domains being hosted by PowerDNS Authoritative Servers before 2.9.21.1.
      </para>
      <para>
	While the dropping of queries does not aid sophisticated spoofing attempts, it does facilitate simpler attacks.

      <para>
	Affected versions of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server can be made to respond to DNS responses, thus enabling
	an attacker to setup a packet loop between two PowerDNS servers, perpetually answering each other's answers. In some scenarios,
	a server could also be made to talk to itself, achieving the same effect.
      </para>
      <para>
	If enough bouncing traffic is generated, this will overwhelm the server or network and disrupt service.
      </para>
      <para>
	As a workaround, if upgrading to a non-affected version is not possible, several options are available. The issue is caused by the packet-cache, which can be disabled by setting 'cache-ttl=0', 
	although this does incur a performance penalty. This can be partially addressed by raising the query-cache-ttl to a (far) higher value.
      </para>
      <para>
	Alternatively, on Linux systems with a working iptables setup, 'responses' sent to the PowerDNS Authoritative Server 'question' address can be
	blocked by issuing:
	<screen>
	  iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dst $AUTHIP --dport 53 \! -f -m u32 --u32 "0>>22&amp;0x3C@8>>15&amp;0x01=1" -j DROP 
	</screen>
	If this command is used on a router or firewall, substitute FORWARD for INPUT.
      </para>
      <para>
	To solve this issue, we recommend upgrading to the latest packages available for your system. 
	Tarballs and new static builds (32/64bit, RPM/DEB) of 2.9.22.5 and 3.0.1 have been uploaded to 
	<ulink url="http://www.powerdns.com/content/downloads.html">our download site</ulink>. 
	Kees Monshouwer has provided updated CentOS/RHEL packages in <ulink url="http://www.monshouwer.eu/download/3th_party/">his repository</ulink>. Debian, Fedora and SuSE should have packages available shortly after this announcement.

	    For those running custom PowerDNS versions, just applying this patch may be easier:

<sect1 id="testing">
<title>Testing your install</title>
      <para>
	After installing, it is a good idea to test the basic functionality of the software before configuring database backends.
	For this purpose, PowerDNS contains the 'bindbackend' which has a domain built in example.com, which is
	officially reserved for testing.

	To test, edit <filename>pdns.conf</filename> and add the following if not already present:
	
	<screen>
	  launch=bind
	  bind-example-zones
	</screen>

	<warning>
	  <para>
	    As of 2.9.21, the BIND backend no longer features the 'bind-example-zones' command.
	  </para>
	</warning>

	This configures powerdns to 'launch' the bindbackend, and enable the example zones. To fire up PDNS in testing mode, execute: 
	<command>/etc/init.d/pdns monitor</command>, where you may have to substitute the location of your SysV init.d location you 
	specified earlier.

	In monitor mode, the pdns process runs in the foreground and is very verbose, which is perfect for testing your install.
	
	If everything went all right, you can query the example.com domain like this:
	<screen>
	  <command>host www.example.com 127.0.0.1</command>
	</screen>
	www.example.com should now have IP address 1.2.3.4. The <command>host</command> command can usually be found in the dnsutils 
	package of your operating system. Alternate command is: <command>dig www.example.com A @127.0.0.1</command> or even 
	<command>nslookup www.example.com 127.0.0.1</command>, although nslookup is not advised for DNS diagnostics.

    <title>Basic setup: configuring database connectivity</title>
    <para>
      This chapter shows you how to configure the Generic MySQL backend, which we like a lot. But feel free to use any of the myriad
      other backends.
      This backend is called 'gmysql', and needs to be configured
      in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>. Add the following lines, adjusted for your local setup:
      
      <screen>
	launch=gmysql
	gmysql-host=127.0.0.1
	gmysql-user=root
	gmysql-dbname=pdns
      </screen>
      
      Remove any earlier <command>launch</command> statements. Also remove the <command>bind-example-zones</command>
      statement as the <command>bind</command> module is no longer launched.
    </para>
    <para>
      <warning>
	<para>
	  Make sure that you can actually resolve the hostname of your database without accessing the database! It is advised to supply
	  an IP address here to prevent chicken/egg problems!
	</para>
      </warning>
      <warning>
	<para>
	  Be very very sure that you configure the *g*mysql backend and not the mysql backend. See
	  <xref linkend="generic-mypgsql-backends"/>. If you use the 'mysql' backend things will only appear to work.
	  (The 'mysql' backend was removed in version 3.1).
	</para>
      </warning>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now start PDNS using the monitor command:
      <screen>
	# /etc/init.d/pdns monitor
	(...)
	15:31:30 About to create 3 backend threads
	15:31:30 [gMySQLbackend] Failed to connect to database: Error: Unknown database 'pdns'

	15:31:30 [gMySQLbackend] Failed to connect to database: Error: Unknown database 'pdns'
      </screen>
      
      This is as to be expected - we did not yet add anything to MySQL for PDNS to read from. At this point you may also see
      other errors which indicate that PDNS either could not find your MySQL server or was unable to connect to it. Fix these 
      before proceeding.

	Connect to MySQL as a user with sufficient privileges and issue the following commands:
   <programlisting><xi:include  href="../no-dnssec.schema.mysql.sql"  parse="text"  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>
   	<screen>

GRANT SELECT ON supermasters TO pdns;
GRANT ALL ON domains TO pdns;
GRANT ALL ON records TO pdns;
	</screen>
	
	Now we have a database and an empty table. PDNS should now be able to launch in monitor mode and display no errors:

	<screen>
	  # /etc/init.d/pdns monitor
	  (...)
	  15:31:30 PowerDNS 1.99.0 (Mar 12 2002, 15:00:28) starting up

	  15:39:55 [gMySQLbackend] MySQL connection succeeded
	  15:39:55 [gMySQLbackend] MySQL connection succeeded
	</screen>
	
	A sample query sent to the database should now return quickly without data:
	<screen>
	  $ host www.test.com 127.0.0.1
	  www.test.com A record currently not present at localhost
	</screen>

	And indeed, the control console now shows:
	<screen>
	  Mar 12 15:41:12 We're not authoritative for 'www.test.com', sending unauth normal response
	</screen>

	Now we need to add some records to our database:
	<screen>
	  # mysql pdnstest
	  mysql> INSERT INTO domains (name, type) values ('test.com', 'NATIVE');
	  INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, content, type,ttl,prio)

	<warning><para>Host names and the MNAME of a SOA records are NEVER terminated with a '.' in PowerDNS storage! If a trailing '.' is present
    it will inevitably cause problems, problems that may be hard to debug.</para></warning>
	If we now requery our database, <command>www.test.com</command> should be present:
	<screen>
	  $ host www.test.com 127.0.0.1
	  www.test.com        	A	199.198.197.196
	  
	  $ host -v -t mx test.com 127.0.0.1

	  Additional information:
	  mail.test.com       	120	IN	A	195.194.193.192
	</screen>
	
	To confirm what happened, issue the command <command>SHOW *</command> to the control console:
	<screen>
	  % show *
	  corrupt-packets=0,latency=0,packetcache-hit=2,packetcache-miss=5,packetcache-size=0,

	  timedout-packets=0,udp-answers=7,udp-queries=7,
	  % 
	</screen>
	The actual numbers will vary somewhat. Now enter <command>QUIT</command> and start PDNS as a regular daemon, and check launch status:

	<screen>
	  # /etc/init.d/pdns start 
	  pdns: started
	  # /etc/init.d/pdns status

  <chapter id="pipebackend-dynamic-resolution">
    <title>Dynamic resolution using the PipeBackend</title>
    <para>
      Also included in the PDNS distribution is the PipeBackend. The PipeBackend is primarily meant for
      allowing rapid development of new backends without tight integration with PowerDNS. It allows
      end-users to write PDNS backends in any language. A perl sample is provided.

      The PipeBackend is also very well suited for dynamic resolution of queries. Example applications include
      DNS based load balancing, geo-direction, DNS based failover with low TTLs.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Pipe Backend also has a separate chapter in the backends appendix, see <xref linkend="pipebackend"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  The Pipe Backend currently does not function under FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x, probably due to unfavorable interactions between
	  its threading implementation and the fork system call.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Interestingly, the Linux PowerDNS binary running under the Linuxulator on FreeBSD does work.

    <sect1 id="pipe-and-bind"><title>Deploying the PipeBackend with the BindBackend</title>
      <para>
        Included with the PDNS distribution is the example.pl backend which has knowledge of the example.com zone, just like
        the BindBackend. To install both, add the following to your <filename>pdns.conf</filename>:
        <screen>
          launch=pipe,bind
          bind-example-zones
          pipe-command=location/of/backend.pl
        </screen>
        Please adjust the <command>pipe-command</command> statement to the location of the unpacked PDNS distribution. If your backend is slow,
	raise <command>pipe-timeout</command> from its default of 2000ms.

        Now launch PDNS in monitor mode, and perform some queries. Note the difference with the earlier experiment where only the 
        BindBackend was loaded. The PipeBackend is launched first and thus gets queried first.

        The sample backend.pl script knows about:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      webserver.example.com A records pointing to 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, 1.2.3.6

  <chapter id="monitoring">
    <title>Logging &amp; Monitoring Authoritative Server performance</title>
    <para>
      In a production environment, you will want to be able to monitor PDNS performance. For this purpose, currently 
      two methods are available, the webserver and the init.d
<command>dump</command>, <command>show</command> and 
      <command>mrtg</command>, commands. Furthermore, PDNS can perform a configurable amount of operational logging. This chapter
	also explains how to configure syslog for best results.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="webserver"><title>Webserver</title>
      <para>
	To launch the internal webserver, add a <command>webserver</command> statement to the pdns.conf. This 
	will instruct the PDNS daemon to start a webserver on localhost at port 8081, without password protection. 
	Only local users (on the same host) will be able to access the webserver by default.

	The webserver 	lists a lot of information about the PDNS process, including frequent queries, frequently failing queries, 
	lists of remote hosts sending queries, hosts sending corrupt queries etc. The webserver does not allow
	remote management of the daemon.

	The following nameserver related configuration items are available:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>

      <sect1 id="syslog"><title>Operational logging using syslog</title>
      <para>(<command>logging-facility</command> is available from 1.99.10 and onwards)</para>
      <para>
	This chapter assumes familiarity with syslog, the unix logging device. PDNS logs messages with different levels. The more urgent the 
	message, the lower the 'priority'. By default, PDNS will only log messages with an urgency of 3 or lower, but this can be changed
	using the <command>loglevel</command> setting in the configuration file. Setting it to 0 will eliminate all logging, 9 will log
	everything.
      </para>
      <para>
	By default, logging is performed under the 'DAEMON' facility which is shared with lots of other programs. If you regard nameserving
	as important, you may want to have it under a dedicated facility so PDNS can log to its own files, and not clutter generic files.
      </para>
      <para>
	For this purpose, syslog knows about 'local' facilities, numbered from LOCAL0 to LOCAL7. To move PDNS logging to LOCAL0, add 
	<command>logging-facility=0</command> to your configuration.
      </para>
      <para>
	Furthermore, you may want to have separate files for the differing priorities - preventing lower priority messages from obscuring 
	important ones.
      </para>
      <para>
	A sample syslog.conf might be:
	<programlisting>
local0.info                       -/var/log/pdns.info
local0.warn                       -/var/log/pdns.warn
local0.err                        /var/log/pdns.err
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Where local0.err would store the really important messages. For performance and disk space reasons, it is advised
	to audit your syslog.conf for statements also logging PDNS activities. Many syslog.confs have a '*.*' statement to
	/var/log/syslog, which you may want to remove.
      </para>
      <para>
	For performance reasons, be especially certain that no large amounts of synchronous logging take place. Under Linux, this 
	is indicated by file names not starting with a '-' - indicating a synchronous log, which hurts performance.
      </para>
      <para>
	Be aware that syslog by default logs messages at the configured priority and higher! To log only info messages, use
	<command>local0.=info</command>.

  <chapter id="security"><title>Security settings &amp; considerations</title>
    <sect1 id="settings"><title>Settings</title>
      <para>PDNS has several options to easily allow it to run more securely. Most notable are the <command>chroot</command>, 
	<command>setuid</command> and <command>setgid</command> options which can be specified.</para>
      <para>
	For additional information on PowerDNS security, PowerDNS security incidents and PowerDNS security policy, see <xref linkend="security-policy"/>.
      </para>
	<sect2><title>Running as a less privileged identity</title>
	<para>
	  By specifying <command>setuid</command> and <command>setgid</command>, PDNS changes to this identity shortly after
	  binding to the privileged DNS ports. These options are highly recommended. It is suggested that a separate identity
	  is created for PDNS as the user 'nobody' is in fact quite powerful on most systems.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Both these parameters can be specified either numerically or as real names.
	  You should set these parameters immediately if they are not set!
	</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2><title>Jailing the process in a chroot</title>
	<para>
	  The <command>chroot</command> option secures PDNS to its own directory so that even if it should become compromised and
	  under control of external influences, it will have a hard time affecting the rest of the system.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Even though this will hamper hackers a lot, chroot jails have been known to be broken. 
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      When chrooting PDNS, take care that backends will be able to get to their files. Many databases need access to a UNIX 
	      domain socket which should live within the chroot. It is often possible to hardlink such a socket into the chroot dir.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      When running with master or slave support, be aware that many operating systems need access to specific libraries
	      (often <filename>/lib/libnss*</filename>) in order to support resolution of domain names! You can also hardlink these.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      In addition, make sure that <filename>/dev/log</filename> is available from within the chroot. Logging will silently fail
	      over time otherwise (on logrotate).
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para><para>
	  The default PDNS configuration is best chrooted to <filename>./</filename>, which boils down to the configured location
	  of the controlsocket. 
	</para><para>
	  This is achieved by adding the following to pdns.conf: <command>chroot=./</command>, and restarting PDNS.
	</para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="considerations"><title>Considerations</title>
      <para>
	In general, make sure that the PDNS process is unable to execute commands on your backend database. 
	Most database backends will only need SELECT privilege. Take care to not connect to your database as the 'root' 
	or 'sa' user, and configure the chosen user to have very slight privileges.
      </para>
      <para>
	Databases empathically do not need to run on the same machine that runs PDNS! In fact, in benchmarks
	it has been discovered that having a separate database machine actually improves performance.
      </para>
      <para>
	Separation will enhance your database security highly. Recommended.

  <chapter id="virtual"><title>Virtual hosting</title>
    <para>
      It may be advantageous to run multiple separate PDNS installations on a single host, for example to make sure
      that different customers cannot affect each others zones. PDNS fully supports running multiple instances on one host.
    </para>
    <para>
      To generate additional PDNS instances, copy the init.d script <filename>pdns</filename> to <filename>pdns-name</filename>, 
      where <filename>name</filename> is the name of your virtual configuration. Must not contain a - as this will confuse the 
      script.
    </para>
    <para>
      When you launch PDNS via this renamed script, it will seek configuration instructions not in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>
      but in <filename>pdns-name.conf</filename>, allowing for separate specification of parameters.

    <sect1><title>General advice</title>
    <para>
      In general, best performance is achieved on recent Linux 2.6 kernels and using MySQL, although many of the largest PowerDNS 
      installations are based on PostgreSQL. FreeBSD appears to achieve lower packet rates both for the PowerDNS recursor as for the 
      authoritative nameserver, this is still being investigated. No comparative measurements have been done for Solaris installations.
    </para>
    <para>
      On Linux, make sure to read <xref linkend="nptl"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Database servers can require configuration to achieve decent performance. It is especially worth noting that 
      several vendors ship PostgreSQL with a slow default configuration.
    </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="nptl">
      <title>Native Posix Thread Library vs LinuxThreads</title>
      <para>
	To get the best performance under Linux, especially on SMP
	systems, the use of NPTL is advised. The difference in
	performance can be over a factor of ten in some circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
	NPTL is the default library on modern Linux distributions, so
	there is generally not a problem, except if you use a
	statically compiled version that, for portability reasons,

      <para>
	When running a PowerDNS-provided static binary of 2.9.18 or
	lower, it may make sense to recompile, or to upgrade to a
	newer version, if available. When recompiling, be sure to use
	a supported compiler, like g++ &gt;3.2. You might also consider
	moving to a distribution supplied version.
      </para>
      <para>
	A good indication that your installation might benefit from
	such an upgrade is to watch the 'cs' count in the output of
	vmstat 1. If this is very high (&gt; 10000), you are suffering
	from a LinuxThreads performance problem called 'overspin'.

    <title>Performance related settings</title>
    <para>
      Different backends will have different characteristics - some will want to have more parallel
      instances than others. In general, if your backend is latency bound, like most relational databases are, 
      it pays to open more backends.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is done with the <command>distributor-threads</command> setting. Of special importance is the choice between 1
      or more backends. In case of only 1 thread, PDNS reverts to unthreaded operation which may be a lot faster, depending
      on your operating system and architecture.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another very important setting <command>cache-ttl</command>. PDNS caches entire packets it sends out so as to save the
      time to query backends to assemble all data. The default setting of 20 seconds may be low for high traffic sites, a value of
      60 seconds rarely leads to problems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some PDNS operators set cache-ttl to many hours or even days, and use <command>pdns_control purge</command> to selectively
      or globally notify PDNS of changes made in the backend. Also look at the Query Cache described in this chapter. It may
      materially improve your performance.
    </para>
    <para>
      To determine if PDNS is unable to keep up with packets, determine the value of the <command>qsize-q</command> variable. 
      This represents the number of packets waiting for database attention. During normal operations the queue should be small. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Much the same holds for the <command>wildcards</command> setting. On by default, each non-existent query will lead to a number of additional
      wildcard queries. If it is known that the backends do not contain wildcard records, performance can be improved by adding <command>wildcards=no</command>
      to <filename>pdns.conf</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Logging truly kills performance as answering a question from the cache is an order of magnitude less work than logging a 
      line about it. Busy sites will prefer to turn <command>log-dns-details</command> and <command>log-failed-updates</command>
      off.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="packetcache"><title>Packet Cache</title>
      <para>
	PDNS by default uses the 'Packet Cache' to recognise identical questions and supply them with identical answers, without any further 
	processing. The default time to live is 10 seconds. It has been observed that the utility of the packet cache increases with the load on 
	your nameserver. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Not all backends may benefit from the packetcache. If your backend is memory based and does not lead to context switches, the packetcache
	may actually hurt performance. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The size of the packetcache can be observed with <command>/etc/init.d/pdns show packetcache-size</command>
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="querycache"><title>Query Cache</title>
      <para>
	Besides entire packets, PDNS can also cache individual backend queries. Each DNS query leads to a number of backend queries,
	the most obvious additional backend query is the check for a possible CNAME. So, when a query comes in for the 'A' record for
	'www.powerdns.com', PDNS must first check for a CNAME for 'www.powerdns.com'.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Query Cache caches these backend queries, many of which are quite repetitive. PDNS only caches queries with no answer,
	or with exactly one. In the future this may be expanded but this lightweight solution is very simple and therefore fast.
      </para>
      <para>
	Most gain is made from caching negative entries, ie, queries that have no answer. As these take little memory to store and
	are typically not a real problem in terms of speed-of-propagation, the default TTL for negative queries is a rather high 60 seconds.
      </para>
      <para>
	This only is a problem when first doing a query for a record, adding it, and immediately doing a query for that record again. It may
	then take up to 60 seconds to appear. Changes to existing records however do not fall under the negative query ttl 
	(<command>negquery-cache-ttl</command>), but under the generic <command>query-cache-ttl</command> which defaults to 20 seconds.
      </para>
      <para>
	The default values should work fine for many sites. When tuning, keep in mind that the Query Cache mostly saves database access 
	but that the Packet Cache also saves a lot of CPU because 0 internal processing is done when answering a question from the
	Packet Cache.

  <sect1 id="from2.9to3.0"><title>From PowerDNS Authoritative Server 2.9.x to 3.0</title>
  <para>
    The 3.0 release of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is significantly different from previous 2.9.x versions. This section lists
    important things to be aware of.
  </para>
  <para><warning><para>
    Version 3.0 of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is the biggest change in PowerDNS history. In some senses, this means that
    it behaves somewhat like a '1.0' version. We advise operators to carefully perform the upgrade process from 2.9.x, and
    if possible test on a copy of the database beforehand. 
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition, it may also be useful to have a support agreement in place during such upgrades.
    For first class and rapid support, please contact powerdns-support@netherlabs.nl, or see <ulink url="www.powerdns.com"/>. Alternatively,
    the <ulink url="http://wiki.powerdns.com">PowerDNS Community</ulink> can be very helpful too.
  </para>
  </warning></para>
  <para>
    With similar settings, version 3.0 will most likely use a lot more memory than 2.9. This is due to the new DNSSEC key &amp; signature caches, but 
    also because the database query cache will now store multiple row answers, which it did not do previously. Memory use can be brought down again
    by tuning the cache-ttl settings.
  </para>
  <para>
    Performance may be up, or it may be down. We appreciate that this is spotty guidance, but depending on your setup, lookups may be a lot faster or a
    lot slower. The improved database cache may prove to be a big benefit, and improve performance dramatically. This could be offset by a near 
    duplication of database queries needed because of more strict interpretation of DNS standards.
  </para>
  <para>
    PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0 contains a completely renewed implementation of the core DNS 'Algorithm', loosely specified in RFC 1034.
    As stated above, our new implementation is a lot closer to the original standard. This may mean that version 3.0 may interpret the contents
    of your database differently from how 2.9.x interpreted them. For fully standards confirming zones, there should not be a problem, 
    but if zones were misconfigured (no SOA record, for example), things will be different.
  </para>
  <para>
    When compiling version 3.0, there are now more dependencies than there used to be. Whereas previously, only Boost header files were needed,
    PowerDNS now needs a number of Boost libraries to be installed (like boost-program-options, boost-serialization). In addition, for now Lua 5.1 is 
    a dependency.
  </para>
  <para>
    PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0 comes with DNSSEC support, but this has required big changes to database schemas.
    Each backend lists the changes required. To facilitate a smooth upgrade, the old, non-DNSSEC schema is used by default.
    Features like per-domain metadata, TSIG and DNSSEC itself however need the new schema. Consult your backend documentation
    for the correct 'alter table' statements. Afterwards, set the relevant '-dnssec' setting for your backend (for example: gmysql-dnssec).
  </para>
  <para>
    In version 3.0, "Fancy Records", like URL, CURL and MBOXFW are no longer supported. Support may come back in later versions.
    In addition, the LDAP Backend has moved to 'unmaintained' status.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: Yes, as long as the relevant '-dnssec' setting is not enabled. These settings
	      are typically called 'gmysql-dnssec', 'gpgsql-dnssec', 'gsqlite3-dnssec'. If this setting IS
	      enabled, 3.x expects the new schema to be in place.

	<term>Q: If I run 3.0 with the new schema, and I have set '-dnssec', do I need to rectify my zones?</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: Yes. If the '-dnssec' setting is enabled, PowerDNS expects the 'auth' field to be filled out correctly.
	      When slaving zones this happens automatically. For other zones, run 'pdnssec rectify-zone zonename'. Even if
	      a zone is not DNSSEC secured, as long as the new schema is in place, the zone must be rectified (or at least
	      have the 'auth' field set correctly).

	  <term>Q: I want to fill out the 'auth' and 'ordername' fields directly, how do I do this?</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: The 'auth' field should be '1' or 'true' for all records that are within your zone. For a zone without delegations,
	      this means 'auth' should always be set. If you have delegations, both the NS records for that delegation and possible glue
	      records for it should not have 'auth' set.

	      A: Not always. The core DNS logic of 3.0 was changed, so even if no changes are made to the database,
	      you may get different answers. This might happen for zones without SOA records for example, which used
	      to (more or less) work. An upgrade from 2.9.x to 3.0 should always be monitored carefully.

  <title>Serving authoritative DNSSEC data</title>
  <para>
    (only available in PowerDNS 3.0 and beyond, not yet available in the PowerDNS Recursor)
  </para>
  <para>
    PowerDNS contains support for DNSSEC, enabling the easy serving of DNSSEC secured data,
    with minimal administrative overhead.
  </para>
  <para>
    In PowerDNSSEC, DNS and signatures and keys are (usually) treated as separate entities. The domain &amp; record
    storage is thus almost completely devoid of DNSSEC record types.
  </para>
  <para>
    Instead, keying material is stored separately, allowing operators to focus on the already complicated task 
    of keeping DNS data correct. In practice, DNSSEC related material is often stored within the same database, 
    but within separate tables.
  </para>
  <para>
    If a DNSSEC configuration is found for a domain, the PowerDNS daemon will provide keys, signatures and (hashed)
    denials of existence automatically.
  </para>
  <para>
    As an example, securing an existing zone can be as simple as:
    <screen>
$ pdnssec secure-zone powerdnssec.org
$ pdnssec rectify-zone powerdnssec.org
    </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
    Alternatively, PowerDNS can serve pre-signed zones, without knowledge of private keys.
  </para>
  <section id="dnssec-introduction">
  <title>A brief introduction to DNSSEC</title>
  <para>
    DNSSEC is a complicated subject, but it is not required to know all the ins and outs of this protocol to be able to use PowerDNSSEC.
    In this section, we explain the core concepts that are needed to operate a PowerDNSSEC installation.
  </para>
  <para>
    Zone material is enhanced with signatures using 'keys'. Such a signature (called an RRSIG) is a cryptographic guarantee that the data served
    is the original data. DNSSEC keys are asymmetric (RSA, DSA or GOST), the public part is published over DNS and is called a 
    DNSKEY record, and is used for verification. The private part is used for signing and is never published.
  </para>
  <para>
    To make sure that the internet knows that the key that is used for signing is the authentic key, confirmation can be gotten from
    the parent zone. This means that to become operational, a zone operator will have to publish a representation of the signing key to 
    the parent zone, often a ccTLD or a gTLD. This representation is called a DS record, and is a shorter (hashed) version of the DNSKEY.
  </para>
  <para>
    Once the parent zone has the DS, and the zone is signed with the DNSSEC key, we are done in theory. 
  </para>
  <para>
    However, for a variety of reasons, most DNSSEC operations run with another layer of keys. The so called 'Key Signing Key' is sent to the
    parent zone, and this Key Signing Key is used to sign a new set of keys called the Zone Signing Keys.
  </para>
  <para>
    This setup allows us to change our keys without having to tell the zone operator about it.
  </para>
  <para>
    A final challenge is how to DNSSEC sign the answer 'no such domain'. In the language of DNS, the way to say 'there is no such domain' (NXDOMAIN)
    or there is no such record type is to send an empty answer. Such empty answers are universal, and can't be signed.
  </para>
  <para>
    In DNSSEC parlance we therefore sign a record that says 'there are no domains between A.powerdnssec.org and C.powerdnssec.org'. This 
    securely tells the world that B.powerdnssec.org does not exist. This solution is called NSEC, and is simple but has downsides - it also 
    tells the world exactly which records DO exist. 
  </para>
  <para>
    So alternatively, we can say that if a certain mathematical operation (an 'iterated salted hash') is performed on a question, that
    no valid answers exist that have as outcome of this operation an answer between two very large numbers. This leads to the same 'proof of
    non-existence'. This solution is called NSEC3.
  </para>
  <para>
    A PowerDNSSEC zone can either be operated in NSEC or in one of two NSEC3 modes ('inclusive' and 'narrow').

  <section id="dnssec-supported">

    PowerDNSSEC aims to serve unexciting, standards compliant, DNSSEC information. One goal is to have
    relevant parts of our output be identical or equivalent to important fellow-traveller software like NLNetLabs'
    NSD. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Particularly, if a PowerDNSSEC secured zone is transferred via AXFR, it should be able to contain the same records 
    as when that zone was signed using 'ldns-signzone' using the same keys and settings.

  <para>
    Traditionally, DNSSEC signatures have been added to unsigned zones, and then this signed zone
    could be served by any DNSSEC capable authoritative server. PowerDNS supports this mode fully.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition, PowerDNS supports taking care of the signing itself, in which case PowerDNS operates differently
    from most tutorials and handbooks. This mode is easier however.

  <title>Migration</title>
  <para>
    This chapter discusses various migration strategies, from existing PowerDNS setups, from existing unsigned installations
    and finally from previous non-PowerDNS DNSSEC deployments.
  </para>
  <section id="powerdnssec-migration"><title>From an existing PowerDNS installation</title>
    <para>
      To migrate an existing database-backed PowerDNS installation, a few changes must be made to the database schema.
      First, the records table gains two new fields: 'auth' and 'ordername'. Some data in a zone, like glue records, should 
      not be signed, and this is signified by setting 'auth' to 0.
    </para>
    <para>
    <warning><para>Once the database schema has been updated, and the relevant 'gsql-dnssec' switch has been set, stricter
      rules apply for filling out the database! The short version is: run pdnssec rectify-zone on all zones, even
      those not secured with DNSSEC!</para></warning>
    </para>
    <para>
      Additionally, NSEC and NSEC3 in non-narrow mode require ordering data in order to perform (hashed) denial of existence. The 'ordername'
      field is used for this purpose.
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally, two new tables are needed. DNSSEC keying material is stored in the 'cryptokeys' table (in a portable standard format). 
      Domain metadata is stored in the 'domainmetadata' table. This includes NSEC3 settings.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the database schema has been changed for DNSSEC usage (see the relevant backend chapters or <ulink url="http://wiki.powerdns.com/trac/wiki/PDNSSEC">the PowerDNSSEC wiki</ulink> for the update statements), the 'pdnssec'
      tool can be used to fill out keying details, and 'rectify' the auth and ordername fields.
    </para>
    <para>
      In short, 'pdnssec secure-zone powerdnssec.org ; pdnssec rectify-zone powerdnssec.org' will deliver a correctly NSEC signed zone.
    </para>
    <para>
      In addition, so will the 'zone2sql' import tool when run with the '--dnssec' flag.

      Industry standard signed zones can be served natively by PowerDNS, without changes. In such cases, signing
      happens externally to PowerDNS, possibly via OpenDNSSEC, ldns-sign or dnssec-sign. 
    </para>
    <para>
      PowerDNS needs to know if a zone should receive DNSSEC processing. To configure, run 'pdnssec set-presigned zone'.
    </para>
    <para><warning><para>Right now, you will also need to configure NSEC(3) settings for pre-signed zones using 'pdnssec set-nsec3'. Default

    <section id="dnssec-dnssec-migration-live"><title>From existing DNSSEC non-PowerDNS setups, live signing</title>
    <para>
      The 'pdnssec' tool features the option to import zone keys in the industry standard private key format, 
      version 1.2. To import an existing KSK, use 'pdnssec import-zone-key zonename filename KSK', replace KSK 
      by ZSK for a Zone Signing Key.
    </para>
    <para>
      If all keys are imported using this tool, a zone will serve mostly identical records to before, with
      the important change that the RRSIG inception dates will be different.

    <para><note><para>Within PowerDNS, the 'algorithm' for RSASHA1 keys is modulated based on the NSEC3 setting. So

  <title>Records, Keys, signatures, hashes within PowerDNSSEC in online signing mode</title>
  <para>
    Within PowerDNSSEC live signing, keys are stored separately from the zone records. Zone data are only 
    combined with signatures and keys when requests come in over the internet.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each zone can have a number of keys associated with it, with varying key lengths. Typically 1 or at most 2 of these
    keys are employed as actual Zone Signing Keys (ZSKs). During normal operations, this means that only 1 ZSK is 'active', and
    the other is passive. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Should it be desired to 'roll over' to a new key, both keys can temporarily be active (and used for signing), and after a while the
    old key can be inactivated. Subsequently it can be removed.
  </para>
  <para>
    As elucidated above, there are several ways in which DNSSEC can deny the existence of a record, and this setting too is stored
    away from zone records, and lives with the DNSSEC keying material.
  </para>
  <para>
    In order to facilitate interoperability with existing technologies, PowerDNSSEC keys can be imported and exported in industry standard formats.
  </para>
  <para>
    Keys and hashes are configured using the 'pdnssec' tool, which is described next.
  </para>
  <section id="nsecX"><title>(Hashed) Denial of Existence</title>
  <para>
    PowerDNS supports unhashed secure denial of existence using NSEC records. These are generated
    with the help of the (database) backend, which needs to be able to supply the 'previous' and 'next' records
    in canonical ordering.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Generic SQL Backends have fields that allow them to supply these relative record names.
  </para>
  <para>
    In addition, hashed secure denial of existence is supported using NSEC3 records, in two modes, one
    with help from the database, the other with the help of some additional calculations.
  </para>
  <para>
    NSEC3 in 'broad' or 'inclusive' mode works with the aid of the backend, where the backend should
    be able to supply the previous and next domain names in hashed order.
  </para>
  <para>
    NSEC3 in 'narrow' mode uses additional hashing calculations to provide hashed secure denial of existence 'on the fly',
    without further involving the database.
  </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="rrsig"><title>Signatures</title>
  <para>
    In PowerDNS live signing mode, signatures, as served through RRSIG records, are calculated on the fly, and heavily cached. All CPU cores 
    are used for the calculation.
  </para>
  <para>
    RRSIGs have a validity period, in PowerDNS by default this period starts at most a week in the past, and continues
    at least a week into the future.
  </para>

  <section id="dnssec-modes">
  <title>Modes of operation</title>
  <para>
    PowerDNSSEC can operate in several modes. In the simplest situation, there is a single "SQL" database
    that contains, in separate tables, all domain data, keying material and other DNSSEC related settings.
  </para>
  <para>
    This database is then replicated to all PowerDNS instances, which all serve identical records, keys
    and signatures.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this mode of operation, care should be taken that the database replication occurs over a secure network, 
    or over an encrypted connection. This is because keying material, if intercepted, could be used to counterfeit
    DNSSEC data using the original keys.
  </para>
  <para>
    Such a single replicated database requires no further attention beyond monitoring already required during
    non-DNSSEC operations.
  </para>
  <section id="dnssec-presigned"><title>PowerDNSSEC Pre-signed records</title>
  <para>
    In this mode, PowerDNS serves zones that already contain DNSSEC records. Such zones can either be slaved from
    a remote master, or can be signed using tools like OpenDNSSEC, ldns-signzone or dnssec-signzone.
  </para>
  </section>
  <section id="dnssec-frontserver"><title>PowerDNSSEC Front-signing</title>
    <para>
      As a special feature, PowerDNSSEC can operate as a signing server which operates as a slave
      to an unsigned master. 
    </para>
    <para>
      In this way, if keying material is available for an unsigned zone that is retrieved from a master server,
      this keying material will be used when serving data from this zone.
    </para>
    <para>
      As part of the zone retrieval, the equivalent of 'pdnssec rectify-zone' is run to make sure 
      that all DNSSEC-related fields are set correctly.

      However, since PowerDNS supports operation with multiple simultaneous backends, this is not a problem.
    </para>
    <para>
      In hybrid mode, keying material and zone records are stored in different backends. This allows for
      'bindbackend' operation in full DNSSEC mode. 
    </para>
    <para>
      To benefit from this mode, include at least one database-based backend in the 'launch' statement. The Generic SQLite backend
      version 3 (gsqlite3) probably complements BIND mode best, since it does not require a database server process.
    </para>
    <warning>
    <para>
      For now, it is necessary to execute a manual SQL 'insert' into the domains table of the backend hosting
      the keying material. This is needed to generate a zone-id for the relevant domain. Sample SQL statement:
      <command>insert into domains (name, type) values ('powerdnssec.org', 'NATIVE');</command>.

  <title>Rules for filling out fields in database backends</title>
  <para>
  <note><para>The BIND Backend automates all the steps outlined below, and does not need 'manual' help
  </para></note></para>
  <para>
    In PowerDNS 3.0 and up, two additional fields are important: 'auth' and 'ordername'. These fields are set correctly
    on an incoming zone transfer, and also by running 'pdnssec rectify-zone'. zone2sql with the --dnssec flag aims to
    do this too but there are minor bugs in there, so please run 'pdnssec rectify-zone' after zone2sql.
    </para>
    <para>The 'auth' field should be set to '1' for 
    data for which the zone itself is authoritative, which includes the SOA record and its own NS records. 
  </para>
  <para>
    The 'auth' field should be 0 however for NS records which are used for delegation, and also for any glue (A, AAAA) records
    present for this purpose. Do note that the DS record for a secure delegation should be authoritative!
  </para>
  <para>
    The 'ordername' field needs to be filled out depending on the NSEC/NSEC3 mode. When running in NSEC3 'Narrow' mode,
    the ordername field is ignored and best left empty. In NSEC mode, the ordername field should be NULL for any glue but filled in
    for delegation NS records and all authoritative records. In NSEC3 opt-out mode (the only NSEC3 mode PowerDNS currently
    supports), any non-authoritative records (as described for the 'auth' field) should have ordername set to NULL.
  </para>
  <para>
    In 'NSEC' mode, it should contain the <emphasis>relative</emphasis> part of a domain name, in reverse order, with dots replaced
    by spaces. So 'www.uk.powerdnssec.org' in the 'powerdnssec.org' zone should have 'uk www' as its ordername.
  </para>
  <para>
    In 'NSEC3' non-narrow mode, the ordername should contain a lowercase base32hex encoded representation of the salted &amp; iterated hash
    of the full record name. <command>pdnssec hash-zone-record zone record</command> can be used to calculate this hash.
  </para>
  <para>
  	In addition, from 3.2 and up, PowerDNS fully supports empty non-terminals. If you have a zone example.com, and a host a.b.c.example.com in it,
  	rectify-zone (and the AXFR client code) will insert b.c.example.com and c.example.com in the records table with type NULL (SQL NULL, not 'NULL').
  	Having these entries provides several benefits. We no longer reply NXDOMAIN for these shorter names (this was an RFC violation but not one that caused trouble).
  	But more importantly, to do NSEC3 correctly, we need to be able to prove existence of these shorter names. The type=NULL records entry gives us a place
  	to store the NSEC3 hash of these names.
  </para>
  <para>
  	If your frontend does not add empty non-terminal names to records, you will get DNSSEC replies of 3.1-quality, which has served many people well, but we
  	suggest you update your code as soon as possible!
  </para>

  <section id="dnssec-security"><title>Security</title>
  <para>
    During typical PowerDNSSEC operation, the private part of the signing keys are 'online', which can be compared
    to operating an HTTPS server, where the certificate is available on the webserver for cryptographic purposes.
  </para>
  <para>
    In some settings, having such (private) keying material available online is considered undesirable. In this case,
    consider running in pre-signed mode.

  <chapter id="tsig"><title>TSIG: shared secret authorization and authentication</title>
  <para><note><para>Available since PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0!</para></note></para>
  <para>
    TSIG, as defined in RFC 2845, is a method for signing DNS messages using shared secrets. 
    Each TSIG shared secret has a name, and PowerDNS can be told to allow zone transfer of a domain
    if the request is signed with an authorized name.
  </para>
  <para>
    In PowerDNS, TSIG shared secrets are stored by the various backends. In case of the popular 
    Generic backends, they can be found in the 'tsigkeys' table. The name can be chosen freely, but
    the algorithm name will typically be 'hmac-md5'. The content is a Base64-encoded secret.
  </para>
  <para>
  <note><para>Most backends require DNSSEC support enabled to support TSIG. For the Generic SQL Backend make sure to use the DNSSEC enabled schema and to turn on the relevant '-dnssec' flag (for example, gmysql-dnssec)!</para></note>
  </para>
  <section id="tsig-outbound-axfr"><title>Provisioning outbound AXFR access</title>
  <para>
    To actually provision a named secret permission to AXFR a zone, set a metadata item in the 'domainmetadata' table
    called 'TSIG-ALLOW-AXFR' with the key name in the content field. 
  </para>
  <para>
    As an example:
<programlisting>
sql> insert into tsigkeys (name, algorithm, secret) values ('test', 'hmac-md5', 'kp4/24gyYsEzbuTVJRUMoqGFmN3LYgVDzJ/3oRSP7ys=');
sql> select id from domains where name='powerdnssec.org';
5
sql> insert into domainmetadata (domain_id, kind, content) values (5, 'TSIG-ALLOW-AXFR', 'test');

$ dig -t axfr powerdnssec.org @127.0.0.1 -y 'test:kp4/24gyYsEzbuTVJRUMoqGFmN3LYgVDzJ/3oRSP7ys='
</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    To ease interoperability, the equivalent configuration above in BIND would look like this:
<programlisting>
key test. {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "kp4/24gyYsEzbuTVJRUMoqGFmN3LYgVDzJ/3oRSP7ys=";
};

zone "powerdnssec.org" {
	type master;
	file "powerdnssec.org";
	allow-transfer {  key test.; };
};
</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    A packet authorized and authenticated by a TSIG signature will gain access to a zone even 
    if the remote IP address is not otherwise allowed to AXFR a zone.
  </para>
  </section>
  <section id="tsig-outbound-notify-axfr"><title>Provisioning signed notification and AXFR requests</title>
  <para>
    To configure PowerDNS to send out TSIG signed AXFR requests for a zone to its master(s), set the
    AXFR-MASTER-TSIG metadata item for the relevant domain to the key that must be used.
  </para>
  <para>
    The actual TSIG key must also be provisioned, as outlined in the previous section.
  </para>
  <para>
    For the popular Generic SQL backends, configuring the use of TSIG for AXFR requests could be achieved as follows:
<programlisting>
sql> insert into tsigkeys (name, algorithm, secret) values ('test', 'hmac-md5', 'kp4/24gyYsEzbuTVJRUMoqGFmN3LYgVDzJ/3oRSP7ys=');
sql> select id from domains where name='powerdnssec.org';
5
sql> insert into domainmetadata (domain_id, kind, content) values (5, 'AXFR-MASTER-TSIG', 'test');
</programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    This setup corresponds to the TSIG-ALLOW-AXFR access rule defined in the previous section.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the interest of interoperability, the configuration above is (not quite) similar to the following BIND statements:
<programlisting>
key test. {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "kp4/24gyYsEzbuTVJRUMoqGFmN3LYgVDzJ/3oRSP7ys=";
};

server 127.0.0.1 {
        keys { test.; };
};

zone "powerdnssec.org" {
 type slave;
 masters { 127.0.0.1; };
 file "powerdnssec.org";
};
</programlisting>
  Except that in this case, TSIG will be used for all communications with the master, not just those about AXFR requests.
  </para>

  <chapter id="allow-axfr-from"><title>AXFR ACLs</title>
  <para>
    Starting with the PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.1, per-zone AXFR ACLs can be stored in the domainmetadata table.
  </para>
  <para>
	Each ACL row can list one subnet (v4 or v6), or the magical value 'AUTO-NS' that tries to allow all potential slaves in.
  </para>
  <para>
    Example:
    <programlisting>
sql> select id from domains where name='example.com';
7
sql> insert into domainmetadata (domain_id, kind, content) values (7,'ALLOW-AXFR-FROM','AUTO-NS');

  <chapter id="domainmetadata"><title>Per zone settings aka Domain Metadata</title>

  <chapter id="recursion"><title>Recursion</title>
    <para>(only available from 1.99.8 and onwards, recursing component available since 2.9.5)</para>
    <para>
      From 2.9.5 onwards, PowerDNS offers both authoritative nameserving capabilities and a recursive nameserver component. These two halves
      are normally separate but many users insist on combining both recursion and authoritative service on one IP address. This can be likened 
      to running Apache and Squid both on port 80.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, many sites want to do this anyhow and some with good reason. For example, a setup like this allows the creation of fake domains
      which only exist for local users. Such domains often don't end on ".com" or ".org" but on ".intern" or ".name-of-isp".
    </para>
    <para>
      PowerDNS can cooperate with either its own recursor or any other you have available to deliver recursive service on its port.
    </para>
    <para>
      By specifying the <command>recursor</command> option in the configuration file, questions requiring recursive treatment will be handed over
      to the IP address specified. An example configuration might be <command>recursor=130.161.180.1</command>, which designates 130.161.180.1 as
      the nameserver to handle recursive queries.
    </para>
    <para>
      Take care not to point <command>recursor</command> to the PowerDNS Authoritative Server itself, which leads to a very tight packet loop!
    </para>
    <para>
      By specifying <command>allow-recursion</command>, recursion can be restricted to netmasks specified. The default is to allow
      recursion from everywhere. Example: <command>allow-recursion=192.168.0.0/24, 10.0.0.0/8, 1.2.3.4</command>.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="recursion-details"><title>Details</title>
      <para>
	Questions carry a number of flags. One of these is called 'Recursion Desired'. If PDNS is configured to allow recursion, AND such a flag
	is seen, AND the IP address of the client is allowed to recurse via PDNS, then the packet may be handed to the recursing backend.
      </para>
      <para>
	If a Recursion Desired packet arrives and PDNS is configured to allow recursion, but not to the IP address of the client, resolution will proceed 
	as if the RD flag were unset and the answer will indicate that recursion was not available.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is also possible to use a resolver living on a different port. To do so, specify a recursor like this: 
	<command>recursor=130.161.180.1:5300</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the backend does not answer a question within a large amount of time, this is logged as 'Recursive query for remote 10.96.0.2 with internal id 0 
	was not answered by backend within timeout, reusing id'. This may happen when using 'BIND' as a recursor as it is prone to drop queries which it can't 
	answer immediately.
      </para>
      <para>
	To make sure that the local authoritative database overrides recursive information, PowerDNS first tries to answer a question from its own database.
	If that succeeds, the answer packet is sent back immediately without involving the recursor in any way. This means that for questions for which there is no answer, PowerDNS will consult the recursor for an recursive query, even if PowerDNS is authoritative for a domain! This will only cause problems if you 'fake' domains which don't really exist.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you want to create such fake domains or override existing domains, please set the <command>allow-recursion-override</command> feature (available from 2.9.14 until 2.9.22.6).
      </para>
      <para>
	Some packets, like those asking for MX records which are needed for SMTP transport of email, can be subject to 'additional processing'. This means
	that a recursing nameserver is obliged to try to add A records (IP addresses) for any of the mail servers mentioned in the packet, should it have 
	these addresses available.
      </para>
      <para>
	If PowerDNS encounters records needing such processing and finds that it does not have the data in its authoritative database, it will send 
	an opportunistic quick query to the recursing component to see if it perhaps has such data. This question is worded such that the recursing nameserver
	should return immediately such as not to block the authoritative nameserver.
      </para>
      <para>
	This marks a change from pre-2.9.5 behaviour where a packet was handed wholesale to the recursor in case it needed additional processing which could
	not proceed from the authoritative database.

		Comma separated netmasks (both IPv4 and IPv6) that are allowed to use the server. The default allows access only from RFC 1918 
		private IP addresses, like 10.0.0.0/8. Due to the aggressive nature of the internet these days, it is highly recommended
		to not open up the recursor for the entire internet. Questions from IP addresses not listed here are ignored and do

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Authoritative zones can transmit a TTL value that is lower than that specified in the parent zone. This is called a
		'delegation inconsistency'. To follow RFC 2181 paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 to the letter, enable this feature. 
		This will mean a slight deterioration of performance, and it will not solve any problems, but does make
		the recursor more standards compliant. Not recommended unless you have to tick an 'RFC 2181 compliant' box. Off by default.

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The DNS is a public database, but sometimes contains delegations to private IP addresses, like for example 127.0.0.1. This can have odd effects, 
		depending on your network, and may even be a security risk. Therefore, since version 3.1.5, the PowerDNS recursor by default does not query
		private space IP addresses. This setting can be used to expand or reduce the limitations.

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		From version 3.1.5 onwards, PowerDNS can read entropy from a (hardware) source. This is used for generating random numbers
		which are very hard to predict. Generally on UNIX platforms, this source will be 
		<filename>/dev/urandom</filename>, which will always supply random numbers, even if entropy is lacking. 
		Change to <filename>/dev/random</filename> if PowerDNS should block waiting for enough entropy to arrive.

		So an entry called 'pc' with
		export-etc-hosts-suffix='home.com' will lead to the
		generation of 'pc.home.com' within the recursor.  An entry
		called 'server1.home' will be stored as 'server1.home',
		regardless of the export-etc-hosts setting. Available

	      </listitem>
	    </varlistentry>
	  </variablelist>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Packet Cache is consulted first, immediately after receiving a packet. This means that a high hitrate for the Packet Cache automatically lowers the cache hitrate of 
	  subsequent caches. This explains why releases 3.2 and beyond see dramatically lower DNS cache hitrates, since this is the first version with a Packet Cache.

      <sect2 id="anti-spoofing"><title>Anti-spoofing</title>
	<para>
	  The PowerDNS recursor 3.0 uses a fresh UDP source port for each outgoing query, making spoofing around 64000 times harder. This 
	  raises the bar from 'easily doable given some time' to 'very hard'. Under some circumstances, 'some time' has been measured at 2 seconds. 
	  This technique was first used by <filename>dnscache</filename> by Dan J. Bernstein.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In addition, PowerDNS detects when it is being sent too many unexpected answers, and mistrusts a proper answer if found within
	  a clutch of unexpected ones.

<screen>
Feb 10 14:16:03 stats: 125784 questions, 13971 cache entries, 309 negative entries, 84% cache hits, outpacket/query ratio 37%, 12% throttled
</screen>
	This means that there are 13791 different names cached, which each may have multiple records attached to them. There are 309 items
	in the negative cache, items of which it is known that don't exist and won't do so for the near future. 84% of incoming questions
	could be answered without any additional queries going out to the net.
      </para>
      <para>
	The outpacket/query ratio means that on average, 0.37 packets were needed to answer a question. Initially this ratio may be well over 100%
	as additional queries may be needed to actually recurse the DNS and figure out the addresses of nameservers.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, 12% of queries were not performed because identical queries had gone out previously, saving load servers worldwide.

      </para>
      <sect2>
	<title>Configuring Lua scripts</title>
	<para>
	  In order to load scripts, the PowerDNS Recursor must have Lua support built in. The packages distributed from the PowerDNS website have this language
	  enabled, other distributions may differ. To compile with Lua support, use: <literal>LUA=1 make</literal> or <literal>LUA=1 gmake</literal>
	  as the case may be. Paths to the Lua include files and binaries may be found near the top of the <filename>Makefile</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If Lua support is available, a script can be configured either via the configuration file, or at runtime via the <command>rec_control</command> tool.
	  Scripts can be reloaded or unloaded at runtime with no interruption in operations. If a new script contains syntax errors, the old script remains in force.
	</para>
	<para>
	  On the command line, or in the configuration file, the setting <command>lua-dns-script</command> can be used to supply a full path to a 'lua' script.
	</para>
	<para>
	  At runtime, <command>rec_control reload-lua-script</command> can be used to either reload the script from its current location, or, when passed
	  a new file name, load one from a new location. A failure to parse the new script will leave the old script in working order.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Finally, <command>rec_control unload-lua-script</command> can be used to remove the currently installed script, and revert to unmodified behaviour.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Writing Lua PowerDNS Recursor scripts</title>
	<para>
	  Once a script is loaded, PowerDNS looks for several functions, as detailed below. All of these functions are optional.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <function>preresolve ( remoteip, domain, qtype )</function> is called before any DNS resolution is attempted, and if this function indicates it, it can supply a direct answer to the 
	  DNS query, overriding the internet. This is useful to combat botnets, or to disable domains unacceptable to an organization for whatever reason.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <function>postresolve ( remoteip, domain, qtype, records, origrcode )</function> is called right before returning a response to a client (and, unless <function>setvariable()</function> is called, to the packet cache too). It allows inspection and modification of almost any detail in the return packet. Available since version 3.4.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <function>function nxdomain ( remoteip, domain, qtype )</function> is called after the DNS resolution process has run its course, but ended in an 'NXDOMAIN' situation, indicating that the domain
	  or the specific record does not exist. This can be used for various purposes.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <function>function nodata ( remoteip, domain, qtype, records )</function> is just like <function>nxdomain</function>, except it gets called when a domain exists, but the requested type does not. This is where one would implement DNS64. Available since version 3.4.
	</para>
		
	<para>
	  All these functions are passed the IP address of the requester, plus the name and type being requested. In return, these functions indicate if they
	  have taken over the request, or want to let normal proceedings take their course.
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      In development versions of the PowerDNS Recursor, versions which were never released except as for testing purposes, these functions had a fourth parameter: localip
	      This parameter has been replaced by <function>getlocaladdress()</function>, for which see below.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
	<para>
	  If a function has taken over a request, it should return an rcode (usually 0), and specify a table with records to be put in the answer section 
	  of a packet. An interesting rcode is NXDOMAIN (3, or <function>pdns.NXDOMAIN</function>), which specifies the non-existence of a domain.
	  Returning -1 and an empty table signifies that the function chose not to intervene.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A minimal sample script:
	</para>
	<para>
	  <screen>
function nxdomain ( ip, domain, qtype )
  print ("nxhandler called for: ", ip, domain, qtype)

  ret={}
  if qtype ~= pdns.A then return -1, ret end  --  only A records
  if not string.find(domain, "^www%.") then return -1, ret end  -- only things that start with www.
  if not matchnetmask(ip, "10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16")  then return -1, ret end -- only interfere with local queries
  ret[1]={qtype=pdns.A, content="127.1.2.3"}    -- add IN A 127.1.2.3
  ret[2]={qtype=pdns.A, content="127.3.2.1"}    -- add IN A 127.3.2.1
  setvariable()
  return 0, ret                 -- return no error, plus records
end
	  </screen>
	</para>
	<para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>
	      Please do NOT use the above sample script in production! Responsible NXDomain redirection requires more attention to detail.
	    </para>
	  </warning>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note that the domain is passed to the Lua function terminated by a '.'.
	  A more complete sample script is provided as <filename>powerdns-example-script.lua</filename> in the PowerDNS Recursor distribution.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The answer content format is (nearly) identical to the storage in the PowerDNS Authoritative Server database, or as in zone files. 
	  The exception is that, unlike in the database, there is no 'prio' field, which means that an MX record with priority 25 pointing to 'smtp.mailserver.com' would be encoded as
	  '25 smtp.mailserver.com.'.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Useful return 'rcodes' include 0 for "no error" and <function>pdns.NXDOMAIN</function> for "NXDOMAIN".

      </para>
      <para>The PowerDNS Recursor consists of very little code, the core DNS logic is less than a thousand lines.</para>
	  
	  <para>This smallness is achieved through the use of some fine infrastructure: MTasker, MOADNSParser, MPlexer and the C++ Standard Library/Boost. This page will explain the conceptual relation between these components, and the route of a packet through the program.</para>
	  
      <sect2>
	<title>The PowerDNS Recursor</title>
	<para>The Recursor started out as a tiny project, mostly a technology demonstration. These days it  consists of the core plus 9000 lines of features. This combined with a need for very high performance has made the recursor code less accessible than it was. The page you are reading hopes to rectify this situation.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Synchronous code using MTasker</title>
	<para>The original name of the program was <command>syncres</command>, which is still reflected in the file name <literal>syncres.cc</literal>, and the class SyncRes. This means that PowerDNS is written naively, with one thread of execution per query, synchronously waiting for packets, Normally this would lead to very bad performance (unless running on a computer with very fast threading, like possibly the Sun CoolThreads family), so PowerDNS employs <ulink url="http://ds9a.nl/mtasker">MTasker</ulink> for very fast userspace threading.</para>
	
	<para>MTasker, which was developed separately from PowerDNS, does not provide a full multithreading system but restricts itself to those features a nameserver needs. It offers cooperative multitasking, which means there is no forced preemption of threads. This in turn means that no two <command>MThreads</command> ever really run at the same time.</para>
	
	<para>This is both good and bad, but mostly good. It means PowerDNS does not have to think about locking. No two threads will ever be talking to the DNS cache at the same time, for example.</para>
	
	<para>It also means that the recursor could block if any operation takes too long.</para>
	
	<para>The core interaction with MTasker are the waitEvent() and sendEvent() functions. These pass around PacketID objects. Everything PowerDNS needs to wait for is described by a PacketID event, so the name is a bit misleading. Waiting for a TCP socket to have data available is also passed via a PacketID, for example.</para>
	
	<para>The version of MTasker in PowerDNS is newer than that described at the MTasker site, with a vital difference being that the waitEvent() structure passes along a copy of the exact PacketID sendEvent() transmitted. Furthermore, threads can trawl through the list of events being waited for and modify the respective PacketIDs. This is used for example with <command>near miss</command> packets: packets that appear to answer questions we asked, but differ in the DNS id. On seeing such a packet, the recursor trawls through all PacketIDs and if it finds any nearmisses, it updates the PacketID::nearMisses counter. The actual PacketID thus lives inside MTasker while any thread is waiting for it.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>MPlexer</title>
	<para>The Recursor uses a separate socket per outgoing query. This has the important benefit of making spoofing 64000 times harder, and additionally means that ICMP errors are reported back to the program. In measurements this appears to happen to one in ten queries, which would otherwise take a two-second timeout before PowerDNS moves on to another nameserver.</para>
	
	<para>However, this means that the program routinely needs to wait on hundreds or even thousands of sockets. Different operating systems offer various ways to monitor the state of sockets or more generally, file descriptors. To abstract out the differing strategies (<function>select</function>, <function>epoll</function>, <function>kqueue</function>, <function>completion ports</function>), PowerDNS contains <command>MPlexer</command> classes, all of which descend from the FDMultiplexer class.</para>
	
	<para>This class is very simple and offers only five important methods: addReadFD(), addWriteFD(), removeReadFD(), removeWriteFD() and run.</para>
	
	<para>The arguments to the <command>add</command> functions consist of an fd, a callback, and a boost::any variable that is passed as a reference to the callback.</para>
	
	<para>This might remind you of the MTasker above, and it is indeed the same trick: state is stored within the MPlexer. As long as a file descriptor remains within either the Read or Write active list, its state will remain stored.</para>
	
	<para>On arrival of a packet (or more generally, when an FD becomes readable or writable, which for example might mean a new TCP connection), the callback is called with the aforementioned reference to its parameter.</para>
	
	<para>The callback is free to call removeReadFD() or removeWriteFD() to remove itself from the active list.</para>
	
	<para>PowerDNS defines such callbacks as newUDPQuestion(), newTCPConnection(), handleRunningTCPConnection().</para>
	
	<para>Finally, the run() method needs to be called whenever the program is ready for new data. This happens in the main loop in pdns_recursor.cc. This loop is what MTasker refers to as <command>the kernel</command>. In this loop, any packets or other MPlexer events get translated either into new MThreads within MTasker, or into calls to sendEvent(), which in turn wakes up other MThreads.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>MOADNSParser</title>
	<para>Yes, this does stand for <command>the Mother of All DNS Parsers</command>. And even that name does not do it justice! The MOADNSParser is the third attempt I've made at writing DNS packet parser and after two miserable failures, I think I've finally gotten it right.</para>
	
	<para>Writing and parsing DNS packets, and the DNS records it contains, consists of four things:
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Parsing a DNS record (from packet) into memory
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Generating a DNS record from memory (to packet)
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Writing out memory to user-readable zone format
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Reading said zone format into memory
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</para>

	<para>This gets tedious very quickly, as one needs to implement all four operations for each new record type, and there are dozens of them.</para>
	
	<para>While writing the MOADNSParser, it was discovered there is a remarkable symmetry between these four transitions. DNS Records are nearly always laid out in the same order in memory as in their zone format representation. And reading is nothing but inverse writing.</para>
	
	<para>So, the MOADNSParser is built around the notion of a <command>Conversion</command>, and we write all Conversion types once. So we have a Conversion from IP address in memory to an IP address in a DNS packet, and vice versa. And we have a Conversion from an IP address in zone format to memory, and vice versa.</para>
	
	<para>This in turn means that the entire implementation of the ARecordContent is as follows (wait for it!)</para>
	
	<literallayout class="monospaced">conv.xfrIP(d_ip);</literallayout>
	<para>Through the use of the magic called <literal>c++ Templates</literal>, this one line does everything needed to perform the four operations mentioned above.</para>
	
	<para>At one point, I got really obsessed with PowerDNS memory use. So, how do we store DNS data in the PowerDNS recursor? I mentioned <command>memory</command> above a lot - this means we could just store the DNSRecordContent objects. However, this would be wasteful.</para>
	
	<para>For example, storing the following:</para>
	
	<literallayout class="monospaced">www.ds9a.nl  3600 IN   CNAME  outpost.ds9a.nl.</literallayout>
	<para>Would duplicate a lot of data. So, what is actually stored is a partial DNS packet. To store the CNAMEDNSRecordContent that corresponds to the above, we generate a DNS packet that has <command>www.ds9a.nl IN CNAME</command> as its question. Then we add <command>3600 IN CNAME outpost.ds9a.nl</command>. as its answer. Then we chop off the question part, and store the rest in the <command>www.ds9a.nl IN CNAME</command> key in our cache.</para>
	
	<para>When we need to retrieve <command>www.ds9a.nl IN CNAME</command>, the inverse happens. We find the proper partial packet, prefix it with a question for <command>www.ds9a.nl IN CNAME</command>, and expand the resulting packet into the answer <command>3600 IN CNAME outpost.ds9a.nl.</command>.</para>
	
	<para>Why do we go through all these motions? Because of DNS compression, which allows us to omit the whole <command>.ds9a.nl.</command> part, saving us 9 bytes. This is amplified when storing multiple MX records which all look more or less alike. This optimization is not performed yet though.</para>
	
	<para>Even without compression, it makes sense as all records are automatically stored very compactly.</para>
	
	<para>The PowerDNS recursor only parses a number of <command>well known record types</command> and passes all other information across verbatim - it doesn't have to know about the content it is serving.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>The C++ Standard Library / Boost</title>
	<para>C++ is a powerful language. Perhaps a bit too powerful at times, you can turn a program into a real freakshow if you so desire.</para>
	
	<para>PowerDNS generally tries not to go overboard in this respect, but we do build upon a very advanced part of the <ulink url="http://www.boost.org">Boost</ulink> C++ library: 
	  <ulink url="http://boost.org/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html">boost::multi index container</ulink>.</para>
	
	<para>This container provides the equivalent of SQL indexes on multiple keys. It also implements compound keys, which PowerDNS uses as well.</para>
	
	<para>The main DNS cache is implemented as a multi index container object, with a compound key on the name and type of a record. Furthermore, the cache is sequenced, each time a record is accessed it is moved to the end of the list. When cleanup is performed, we start at the beginning. New records also get inserted at the end. For DNS correctness, the sort order of the cache is case insensitive.</para>
	
	<para>The multi index container appears in other parts of PowerDNS, and MTasker as well.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Actual DNS Algorithm</title>
	<para>The DNS RFCs do define the DNS algorithm, but you can't actually implement it exactly that way, it was written in 1987.</para>
	
	<para>Also, like what happened to HTML, it is expected that even non-standards conforming domains work, and a sizable fraction of them is misconfigured these days.</para>
	
	<para>Everything begins with SyncRes::beginResolve(), which knows nothing about sockets, and needs to be passed a domain name, dns type and dns class which we are interested in. It returns a vector of DNSResourceRecord objects, ready for writing either into an answer packet, or for internal use.</para>
	
	<para>After checking if the query is for any of the hardcoded domains (localhost, version.bind, id.server), the query is passed to SyncRes::doResolve, together with two vital parameters: the <literal>depth</literal> and <literal>beenthere</literal> set. As the word <command>recursor</command> implies, we will need to recurse for answers. The <command>depth</command> parameter documents how deep we've recursed already.</para>
	
	<para>The <literal>beenthere</literal> set prevents loops. At each step, when a nameserver is queried, it is added to the <literal>beenthere</literal> set. No nameserver in the set will ever be queried again for the same question in the recursion process - we know for a fact it won't help us further. This prevents the process from getting stuck in loops.</para>
	
	<para>SyncRes::doResolve first checks if there is a CNAME in cache, using SyncRes::doCNAMECacheCheck, for the domain name and type queried and if so, changes the query (which is passed by reference) to the domain the CNAME points to. This is the cause of many DNS problems, a CNAME record really means <command>start over with this query</command>.</para>
	
	<para>This is followed by a call do SyncRes::doCacheCheck, which consults the cache for a straight answer to the question (as possibly rerouted by a CNAME). This function also consults the so called negative cache, but we won't go into that just yet.</para>
	
	<para>If this function finds the correct answer, and the answer hasn't expired yet, it gets returned and we are (almost) done. This happens in 80 to 90% of all queries. Which is good, as what follows is a lot of work.</para>
	
	<para>To recap:
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		beginResolve() - entry point, does checks for hardcoded domains
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		doResolve() - start of recursion process, gets passed <literal>depth</literal> of 0 and empty <literal>beenthere</literal> set
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		doCNAMECacheCheck() - check if there is a CNAME in cache which would reroute the query
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		doCacheCheck() - see if cache contains straight answer to possibly rerouted query.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</para>
	<para>If the data we were queried for was in the cache, we are almost done. One final step, which might as well be optional as nobody benefits from it, is SyncRes::addCruft. This function does additional processing, which means that if the query was for the MX record of a domain, we also add the IP address of the mail exchanger.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>The non-cached case</title>
	<para>This is where things get interesting, because we start out with a nearly empty cache and have to go out to the net to get answers to fill it.</para>
	
	<para>The way DNS works, if you don't know the answer to a question, you find somebody who does. Initially you have no other place to go than the root servers. This is embodied in the SyncRes::getBestNSNamesFromCache method, which gets passed the domain we are interested in, as well as the <literal>depth</literal> and <literal>beenthere</literal> parameters mentioned earlier.</para>
	
	<para>From now on, assume our query will be for <command><literal>www.powerdns.com.</literal></command>. SyncRes::getBestNSNamesFromCache will first check if there are NS records in cache for <literal><command>www.powerdns.com.</command></literal>, but there won't be. It then checks <literal>powerdns.com. NS</literal>, and while these records do exist on the internet, the recursor doesn't know about them yet. So, we go on to check the cache for <literal><command>com. NS</command></literal>, for which the same holds. Finally we end up checking for <literal><command>. NS</command></literal>, and these we do know about: they are the root servers and were loaded into PowerDNS on startup.</para>
	
	<para>So, SyncRes::getBestNSNamesFromCache fills out a set with the <command>names</command> of nameservers it knows about for the <command><literal>.</literal></command> zone.</para>
	
	<para>This set, together with the original query <command><literal>www.powerdns.com</literal></command> gets passed to SyncRes::doResolveAt. This function can't yet go to work immediately though, it only knows the names of nameservers it can try. This is like asking for directions and instead of hearing <command>take the third right</command> you are told <command>go to 123 Fifth Avenue, and take a right</command> - the answer doesn't help you further unless you know where 123 Fifth Avenue is.</para>
	
	<para>SyncRes::doResolveAt first shuffles the nameservers both randomly and on performance order. If it knows a nameserver was fast in the past, it will get queried first. More about this later.</para>
	
	<para>Ok, here is the part where things get a bit scary. How does SyncRes::doResolveAt find the IP address of a nameserver? Well, by calling SyncRes::getAs (<command>get A records</command>), which in turn calls.. SyncRes::doResolve. Hang on! That's where we came from! Massive potential for loops here. Well, it turns out that for any domain which can be resolved, this loop terminates. We do pass the <literal>beenthere</literal> set again, which makes sure we don't keep on asking the same questions to the same nameservers.</para>
	
	<para>Ok, SyncRes::getAs will give us the IP addresses of the chosen root-server, because these IP addresses were loaded on startup. We then ask these IP addresses (nameservers can have several) for its best answer for <command><literal>www.powerdns.com.</literal></command>. This is done using the LWRes class and specifically LWRes::asyncresolve, which gets passed domain name, type and IP address. This function interacts with MTasker and MPlexer above in ways which needn't concern us now. When it returns, the LWRes object contains the best answers the queried server had for our domain, which in this case means it tells us about the nameservers of <literal>com.</literal>, and their IP addresses.</para>
	
	<para>All the relevant answers it gives are stored in the cache (or actually, merged), after which SyncRes::doResolveAt (which we are still in) evaluates what to do now.</para>
	
	<para>There are 6 options:
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The final answer is in, we are done, return to SyncRes::doResolve and SyncRes::beginResolve
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The nameserver we queried tells us the domain we asked for authoritatively does not exist. In case of the root-servers, this happens when we query for <emphasis><literal>www.powerdns.kom.</literal></emphasis> for example, there is no <emphasis><literal>kom.</literal></emphasis>. Return to SyncRes::beginResolve, we are done.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A lesser form - it tells us it is authoritative for the query we asked about, but there is no record matching our type. This happens when querying for the IPv6 address of a host which only has an IPv4 address. Return to SyncRes::beginResolve, we are done.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The nameserver passed us a CNAME to another domain, and we need to reroute. Go to SyncRes::doResolve for the new domain.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The nameserver did not know about the domain, but does know who does, a <emphasis>referral</emphasis>. Stay within doResolveAt and loop to these new nameservers.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		The nameserver replied saying <emphasis>no idea</emphasis>. This is called a <emphasis>lame delegation</emphasis>. Stay within SyncRes::doResolveAt and try the other nameservers we have for this domain.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	</para>
	<para>When not redirected using a CNAME, this function will loop until it has exhausted all nameservers and all their IP addresses. DNS is surprisingly resilient that there is often only a single non-broken nameserver left to answer queries, and we need to be prepared for that.</para>
	
	<para>This is the whole DNS algorithm in PowerDNS, all in less than 700 lines of code. It contains a lot of tricky bits though, related to the cache.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Some of the things we glossed over</title>
	<para>Whenever a packet is sent to a remote nameserver, the response time is stored in the SyncRes::s_nsSpeeds map, using an exponentially weighted moving average. This EWMA averages out different response times, and also makes them decrease over time. This means that a nameserver that hasn't been queried recently gradually becomes <command>faster</command> in the eyes of PowerDNS, giving it a chance again.</para>
	
	<para>A timeout is accounted as a 1s response time, which should take that server out of the running for a while.</para>
	
	<para>Furthermore, queries are throttled. This means that each query to a nameserver that has failed is accounted in the <literal>s_throttle</literal> object. Before performing a new query, the query and the nameserver are looked up via shouldThrottle. If so, the query is assumed to have failed without even being performed. This saves a lot of network traffic and makes PowerDNS quick to respond to lame servers.</para>
	
	<para>It also offers a modicum of protection against birthday attack powered spoofing attempts, as PowerDNS will not inundate a broken server with queries.</para>
	
	<para>The negative query cache we mentioned earlier caches the cases 2 and 3 in the enumeration above. This data needs to be stored separately, as it represents <command>non-data</command>. Each negcache query entry is the name of the SOA record that was presented with the evidence of non-existence. This SOA record is then retrieved from the regular cache, but with the TTL that originally came with the NXDOMAIN (case 2) or NXRRSET (case 3).</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>The Recursor Cache</title>
	<para>As mentioned before, the cache stores partial packets. It also stores not the <command>Time To Live</command> of records, but in fact the <command>Time To Die</command>. If the cache contains data, but it is expired, that data should not be deemed present. This bit of PowerDNS has proven tricky, leading to deadlocks in the past.</para>
	
	<para>There are some other very tricky things to deal with. For example, through a process called <command>more details</command>, a domain might have more nameservers than listed in its parent zone. So, there might only be two nameservers for <literal><command>powerdns.com.</command></literal> in the <command><literal>com.</literal></command> zone, but the <command><literal>powerdns.com</literal></command> zone might list more.</para>
	
	<para>This means that the cache should not, when talking to the <command><literal>com.</literal></command> servers later on, overwrite these four nameservers with only the two copies the <command><literal>com.</literal></command> servers pass us.</para>
	
	<para>However, in other cases (like for example for SOA and CNAME records), new data should overwrite old data.</para>
	<para>Note that PowerDNS deviates from RFC 2181 (section 5.4.1) in this respect.</para>
	
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>Some small things</title>
	<para>The server-side part of PowerDNS (<literal>pdns_recursor.cc</literal>), which listens to queries by end-users, is fully IPv6 capable using the ComboAddress class. This class is in fact a union of a <literal>struct sockaddr_in</literal> and a <literal>struct sockaddr_in6</literal>. As long as the <literal>sin_family</literal> (or <literal>sin6_family</literal>) and <literal>sin_port</literal> members are in the same place, this works just fine, allowing us to pass a ComboAddress*, cast to a <literal>sockaddr*</literal> to the socket functions. For convenience, the ComboAddress also offers a length() method which can be used to indicate the length - either sizeof(sockaddr_in) or sizeof(sockaddr_in6).</para>
	
	<para>Access to the recursor is governed through the NetmaskGroup class, which internally contains Netmask, which in turn contain a ComboAddress.</para>

  <chapter id="replication"><title>Master/Slave operation &amp; replication</title>

    <para>
      PDNS offers full master and slave semantics for replicating domain information. Furthermore, PDNS can benefit from native
      database replication.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="native-replication"><title>Native replication</title>
      <para>
	Native replication is the default, unless other operation is specifically configured. Native replication basically means that PDNS will
	not send out DNS update notifications, nor will react to them. PDNS assumes that the backend is taking care of replication unaided.
      </para>
      <para>
	MySQL replication has proven to be very robust and well suited, even over transatlantic connections between badly peering ISPs. Other PDNS
	users employ Oracle replication which also works very well.
      </para>
      <para>
	To use native replication, configure your backend storage to do the replication and do not configure PDNS to do so.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="slave"><title>Slave operation</title>
      <para>
	On launch, PDNS requests from all backends a list of domains which have not been checked recently for changes. This should happen every 
	'<command>refresh</command>' seconds, as specified in the SOA record. All domains that are unfresh are then checked for changes over at their
	master. If the <link linkend="soa-type">SOA</link> serial number there is higher, the domain is retrieved and inserted into the database. In 
	any case, after the check the domain is declared 'fresh', and will only be checked again after '<command>refresh</command>' seconds have passed.
      </para>
      <para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Slave support is OFF by default, turn it on by adding <command>slave</command> to the configuration. The same 
	    holds for master operation. Both can be on simultaneously.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </para>

      <para>
	PDNS also reacts to notifies by immediately checking if the zone has updated and if so, retransfering it.
      </para>
      <para>
	All backends which implement this feature must make sure that they can handle transactions so as to not leave the zone in a half updated state. 
	MySQL configured with either BerkeleyDB or InnoDB meets this requirement, as do PostgreSQL and Oracle. The Bindbackend implements transaction
	semantics by renaming files if and only if they have been retrieved completely and parsed correctly.
      </para>
      <para>
	Slave operation can also be programmed using several pdns_control commands, see <xref linkend="pdnscontrol"/>. The 'retrieve' command
	is especially useful as it triggers an immediate retrieval of the zone from the configured master.
      </para>
      <para>
	Since version 2.9.21, PowerDNS supports multiple masters. For the BIND backend, the native BIND configuration language suffices to specify
	multiple masters, for SQL based backends, list all master servers separated by commas in the 'master' field of the domains table.
      </para>
      <sect2 id="supermaster"><title>Supermaster automatic provisioning of slaves</title>
	<para>
	  PDNS can recognize so called 'supermasters'. A supermaster is a host which is master for domains and for which we are to be a slave. When
	  a master (re)loads a domain, it sends out a notification to its slaves. Normally, such a notification is only accepted if PDNS already 
	  knows that it is a slave for a domain.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, a notification from a supermaster carries more persuasion. When PDNS determines that a notification comes from a supermaster and it 
	  is bonafide, PDNS can provision the domain automatically, and configure itself as a slave for that zone.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Before a supermaster notification succeeds, the following conditions must be met:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>
		The supermaster must carry a SOA record for the notified domain
	    </para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>
		The supermaster IP must be present in the 'supermaster' table

	  So, to benefit from this feature, a backend needs to know about the IP address of the supermaster, and how PDNS will be listed in the set of
	  NS records remotely, and the 'account' name of your supermaster. There is no need to fill the account name out but it does help keep track of
	  where a domain comes from.

      <sect2 id="lua-axfr-script"><title>Modifying a slave zone using a script</title>
      <para>
	As of version 3.0, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server can invoke a Lua script on an incoming AXFR zone transfer. 
	The user-defined function axfrfilter within your script is invoked for each resource record read during the transfer, 
	and the outcome of the function defines what PowerDNS does with the records.
      </para>
      <para>(idea and documentation contributed by Jan-Piet Mens)</para>
      <para>
	What you can accomplish using a Lua script:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Ensure consistent values on SOA</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Change incoming SOA serial number to a YYYYMMDDnn format</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Ensure consistent NS RRset</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>Timestamp the zone transfer with a TXT record</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
To enable a Lua script for a particular slave zone, determine the domain_id for the zone from the `domains` table, and add a row to the `domainmetadata` table for the domain. Supposing the domain we want has an `id` of 3, the following SQL statement will enable the Lua script `my.lua` for that domain:
<programlisting>
	INSERT INTO domainmetadata (domain_id, kind, content) VALUES (3, "LUA-AXFR-SCRIPT", "/lua/my.lua");
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	  The Lua script must both exist and be syntactically correct; if not, the zone transfer is not performed.
      </para>
      <para>Your Lua functions have access to the query codes through a pre-defined Lua table called `pdns`. 
      For example if you want to check for a CNAME record you can either compare `qtype` to the numeric constant 5 or the value 
      `pdns.CNAME` -- they are equivalent.</para>
      <para>
	If your function decides to handle a resource record it must return a result code of 0 together with a Lua table 
	containing one or more replacement records to be stored in the back-end database. If, on the other hand, your 
	function decides not to modify a record, it must return -1 and an empty table indicating that PowerDNS should 
	handle the incoming record as normal.
      </para>
      <para>
	Consider the following simple example:
<programlisting>
	function axfrfilter(remoteip, zone, qname, qtype, ttl, prio, content)

	   -- Replace each HINFO records with this TXT
	   if qtype == pdns.HINFO then
	      resp = {}
	      resp[1] = {    qname   = qname,
		    qtype   = pdns.TXT,
		    ttl   = 99,
		    content   = "Hello Ahu!"
		 }
	      return 0, resp
	   end

	   -- Grab each _tstamp TXT record and add a time stamp
	   if qtype == pdns.TXT and string.starts(qname, "_tstamp.") then
	      resp = {}
	      resp[1] = {
		    qname   = qname,
		    qtype   = qtype,
		    ttl   = ttl,
		    content   = os.date("Ver %Y%m%d-%H:%M")
		 }
	      return 0, resp
	   end

	   resp = {}
	   return -1, resp
	end

	function string.starts(s, start)
	   return s.sub(s, 1, s.len(start)) == start
	end
</programlisting>
    Upon an incoming AXFR, PowerDNS calls our `axfrfilter` function for each record. All HINFO records 
    are replaced by a TXT record with a TTL of 99 seconds and the specified string. TXT Records with 
    names starting with `_tstamp.` get their value (_rdata_) set to the current time stamp. 
    All other records are unhandled.

    <sect1 id="master"><title>Master operation</title>
      <para>
	When operating as a master, PDNS sends out notifications of changes to slaves, which react to these notifications by querying PDNS to see
	if the zone changed, and transferring its contents if it has. Notifications are a way to promptly propagate zone changes to slaves, as 
	described in RFC 1996.
      </para>
      <para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Master support is OFF by default, turn it on by adding <command>master</command> to the configuration. The same 
	    holds for slave operation. Both can be on simultaneously.
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </para>

      <para>
	Left open by RFC 1996 is who is to be notified - which is harder to figure out than it sounds. All slaves for this domain must receive a notification
	but the nameserver only knows the names of the slaves - not the IP addresses, which is where the problem lies. The nameserver itself might
	be authoritative for the name of its secondary, but not have the data available.
      </para>
      <para>
	To resolve this issue, PDNS tries multiple tactics to figure out the IP addresses of the slaves, and notifies everybody. In contrived configurations
	this may lead to duplicate notifications being sent out, which shouldn't hurt.
      </para>
      <para>
	Some backends may be able to detect zone changes, others may chose to let the operator indicate which zones have changed and which haven't.
	Consult the documentation for your backend to see how it processes changes in zones.
      </para>
      <para>
	To help deal with slaves that may have missed notifications, or have failed to respond to them, several override commands are available via 
	the pdns_control tool (<xref linkend="pdnscontrol"/>):

  <chapter id="fancy-records"><title>Fancy records for seamless email and URL integration</title>
    <para>
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    As of PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.0, fancy records are no longer supported!
	  </para>
	</warning>
      </para>
    <para>
      PDNS also supports so called 'fancy' records. A Fancy Record is actually not a DNS record, but it is translated into one. Currently,
      two fancy records are implemented, but not very useful without additional unreleased software. For completeness, they are listed here.
      The software will become available later on and is part of the Express and PowerMail suite of programs.
    </para>
    <para>
      These records imply extra database lookups which has a performance impact. Therefore fancy records are only queried for if they are enabled
      with the <command>fancy-records</command> command in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>. 
    </para>

	      <screen>
		support@yourdomain.com     MBOXFW       you@yourcompany.com
	      </screen>
	      When PDNS encounters a request for an MX record for yourdomain.com it will, if fancy records are enabled, also check for the existence
	      of an MBOXFW record ending on '@yourdomain.com', in which case it will hand out a record containing the configured 
	      <command>smtpredirector</command>. This server should then also be able to access the PDNS database to figure out where mail to 
	      support@yourdomain.com should go to.

	      </screen>
	      A URL record is converted into an A record containing the IP address configured with the <command>urlredirector</command>

	  Besides counters, PDNS also maintains the ringbuffers. A ringbuffer records events, each new event gets a place
	  in the buffer until it is full. When full, earlier entries get overwritten, hence the name 'ring'.
	</para>
    <para>
      By counting the entries in the buffer, statistics can be generated. These statistics can currently only be viewed 
      using the webserver and are in fact not even collected without the webserver running.

	  <term><anchor id="soa-type"/>SOA</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The Start of Authority record is one of the most complex available. It specifies a lot about a domain: the name 
	      of the master nameserver ('the primary'), the hostmaster and a set of numbers indicating how the data in this domain
	      expires and how often it needs to be checked. Further more, it contains a serial number which should rise on each change
	      of the domain.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The stored format is:
	      <screen>
		primary hostmaster serial refresh retry expire default_ttl
	      </screen>
	      Besides the primary and the hostmaster, all fields are numerical. PDNS has a set of default values:
	      <table>
		<title>SOA fields</title>
		<tgroup cols="2">
		  <tbody>
		    <row>
		      <entry>primary</entry><entry><command>default-soa-name</command> configuration option</entry>

		  </tbody>
		</tgroup>
	      </table>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The fields have complicated and sometimes controversial meanings. The 'serial' field is special. If left at 0, the default,
	      PDNS will perform an internal list of the domain to determine highest change_date field of all records within the zone, and use
	      that as the zone serial number. This means that the serial number is always raised when changes are made to the zone, as long
	      as the change_date field is being set. Make sure to check whether your backend of choice supports Autoserial.

	    <term>Q: I get this entry a lot of times in my log file: Authoritative empty NO ERROR to 1.2.3.4 for 'powerdns.nl' (AAAA)..</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		As the name implies, this is not an error. It tells you there are questions for a domain which exists in your database, but for
		which no record of the requested type exists. To get rid of this error, add <command>log-dns-details=off</command> to your
		configuration.

	    <term>Q: Can I launch multiple backends simultaneously?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: You can. This might for example be useful to keep an existing BIND configuration around but to store new zones in, say
		MySQL. The syntax to use is 'launch=bind,gmysql'.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Q: PowerDNS does not give authoritative answers, how come?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: This is almost always not the case. An authoritative answer is recognized by the 'AA' bit being set. Many tools
		prominently print the number of Authority records included in an answer, leading users to conclude that the 
		absence or presence of these records indicates the authority of an answer. This is not the case.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		Verily, many misguided country code domain operators have fallen into this trap and demand authority records, even though
		these are fluff and quite often misleading. Invite such operators to look at section 6.2.1 of RFC 1034, which shows a correct
		authoritative answer without authority records. In fact, none of the non-deprecated authoritative answers shown have authority 
		records!
	      </para>
	      <para>
		Sorry for sounding like DJB on this, but we get so many misguided questions about authority..

	      <para>
		A: If you have no external constraints, the Generic MySQL (gmysql) and Generic PostgreSQL (gpgsql) ones are probably the
		most used and complete.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		The Oracle backend also has happy users, we know of no deployments of the DB2 backend. The BIND backend is pretty capable
		too in fact, but many prefer a relational database.

		A: Read the 'HACKING' file, it lists the build requirements (mostly autoconf, automake, libtool). In many cases, 
		it may be easier to build from the source distribution though. More information for developers

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Your gcc is too old. Versions 2.95.2 and older are not supported. Many distributions have improved gcc 2.95.2

	    <term>Q: PowerDNS crashes when I install the pdns-static .deb on Debian SID</term>

		will go away if you remove setuid and setgid statements from the configuration.

	    <term>Q: Why don't my slaves act on notifications and transfer my updated zone?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: Raise the serial number of your zone. In most backends, this is the first digit of the SOA contents field. If this number
		is lower to equal to that on a slave, it will not consider your zone updated.

	    <term>Q: Can I use a MySQL database with the Windows version of PowerDNS?</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		A: You can. MySQL support is supplied through the ODBC backend, which is compiled into the main binary.
		So if you want to use MySQL you can change the pdns.conf file, which is located in the PowerDNS for Windows directory, to use the 
		correct ODBC data sources.

		If you don't know how to use ODBC with MySQL:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem><para>
		      Download MyODBC from <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</ulink>
		    </para></listitem>
		  <listitem><para>
		      Install the MySQL ODBC driver.
		    </para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		Then you can follow the instructions located in <xref linkend="windows"/>.
		But instead of selecting the Microsoft Access Driver you select the MySQL ODBC Driver and configure it to use your MySQL database.
    
		<note><para>For other databases for which an ODBC driver is available, the procedure is the same as this example.</para></note>

    <sect1 id="pdns-devel-faq"><title>Backend developer HOWTO</title>
      <para>
	Writing backends without access to the full PDNS source means that you need to write code that can be loaded by PDNS at runtime. 
	This in turn means that you need to use the same compiler that we do. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Furthermore, your pdns_server executable must be dynamically linked. The default .rpm PDNS contains a static binary so you need to retrieve the
	dynamic rpm or the dynamic tar.gz or the Debian unstable ('Woody') deb. FreeBSD dynamic releases are forthcoming.
      </para>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Q: Will PDNS drivers work with other PDNS versions than they were compiled for?</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: 'Probably'. We make no guarantees. Efforts have been made to keep the interface between the backend and PDNS as thin
	      as possible. For example, a backend compiled with the 1.99.11 backend development kit works with 1.99.10. But don't count on it.
	      We will notify when we think an incompatible API change has occurred but you are best off recompiling your driver for each
	      new PDNS release.

	  <term>Q: What is in that DNSPacket * pointer passed to lookup!</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A: For reasons outlined above, you should treat that pointer as opaque and only access it via the <function>getRemote()</function> 
	      functions made available and documented above. The DNSPacket class changes a lot and this level of indirection allows for greater
	      changes to be made without changing the API to the backend coder.

      PowerDNS comes with several tools that can be used to do various DNS related things.

      <para>
	Available in PowerDNS 2.9.22 and later.
      </para>
      <para>
	For additional security, operators may prefer to have a 'hidden slave' that sits behind a strong firewall. This slave pulls
	in zones from the outside world, and stores them in a database. This database is then used by publicly accessible nameservers
	to publish zone data.
      </para>
      <para>
	For proper slave operation, master nameservers send out notifications to inform slaves of updates. This is not normally a problem,
	but when operating with a hidden slave behind a firewall, notification packets can't reach the slave.
      </para>
      <para>
	For this purpose, the PowerDNS also supplies a notification proxy. It sits outside the firewall, and accepts notifications from
	remote master servers. It interprets and validates these packets, and then sends on a new notification to the hidden slave.
      </para>
      <para>
	The hidden slave then promptly retrieves an updated zone from the master.

      <para>
        PowerDNS sends out 'HELO\t1', indicating that it wants to speak the
        protocol as defined in this document, version 1. For abi-version 2 or 3, PowerDNS
        sends 'HELO\t2' or 'HELO\t3'.
        
        A PowerDNS Coprocess must then send out a banner, prefixed by 'OK\t', 
        indicating it launched successfully. If it does not support the indicated
        version, it should respond with FAIL, but not exit. Suggested behaviour is
        to try and read a further line, and wait to be terminated.

Q	qname		qclass	qtype	id	remote-ip-address
</screen>
</para>
<para>
pipebackend-abi-version = 2

<para>
pipebackend-abi-version = 3
<screen>
Q	qname		qclass	qtype	id	remote-ip-address	local-ip-address	edns-subnet-address
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Fields are tab separated, and terminated with a single \n. The remote-ip-address is the IP address
of the nameserver asking the question; the local-ip-address is the IP address on which the question
was received.
</para>

<para>
Type is the tag above, qname is the domain the question is about. qclass is
always 'IN' currently, denoting an INternet question. qtype is the kind of
information desired, the record type, like A, CNAME or AAAA. id can be
specified to help your backend find an answer if the id is already known
from an earlier query. You can ignore it unless you want to support AXFR.
</para>

<para>
remote-ip-address is the ip-address of the nameserver asking the question.
local-ip-address is the ip-address that was queried locally. edns-subnet-address
is the actual client subnet as provided via edns-subnet support. Note that for the SOA
query that precedes an AXFR, edns-subnet is always set to 0.0.0.0/0.
</para>

<para>
AXFR-queries look like this:
<screen>
AXFR	id
</screen>
The id is gathered from the answer to a SOA query.

</para>

    <sect3><title>Answers</title>
      <para>

        Each answer starts with a tag, possibly followed by a TAB and more data.
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>DATA</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Indicating a successful line of DATA.

	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>FAIL</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                Indicating a lookup failure. Also serves as 'END'. No further data.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>LOG</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                For specifying things that should be logged. Can only be sent after
                a query and before an END line. After the tab, the message to be
                logged.
                
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>


        So, letting it be known that there is no data consists of sending 'END'
        without anything else.


The answer format (for abi-version 1 and 2):
<screen>
DATA	qname		qclass	qtype	ttl	id	content	
</screen>

'content' is as specified in <xref linkend="types"/>. For MX and SRV, content consists of the priority, followed by a tab, followed by the actual content.
</para>
<para>
A sample dialogue may look like this (note that in reality,
almost all queries will actually be for the ANY qtype):
<screen>
Q	www.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	www.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	3600	1 ws1.ds9a.nl
END
Q	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	CNAME	-1	213.244.168.210
END
Q	wd1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.4
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.5
DATA	ws1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	3600	1	1.2.3.6
END
</screen>

This would correspond to a remote webserver 213.244.168.210 wanting to
resolve the IP address of www.ds9a.nl, and PowerDNS traversing the CNAMEs to
find the IP addresses of ws1.ds9a.nl

Another dialogue might be:
<screen>
Q	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	-1	213.244.168.210
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	86400	1 ahu.ds9a.nl ...
END
AXFR	1
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	SOA	86400	1 ahu.ds9a.nl ...
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	NS	86400	1 ns1.ds9a.nl
DATA	ds9a.nl		IN	NS	86400	1 ns2.ds9a.nl
DATA	ns1.ds9a.nl	IN	A	86400	1 213.244.168.210
DATA	ns2.ds9a.nl	IN	A	86400	1 63.123.33.135
.
.
END
</screen>

This is a typical zone transfer.
	  </para>
<para>
	For abi-version 3, DATA-responses get two extra fields:
<screen>
DATA	scopebits	auth	qname		qclass	qtype	ttl	id	content	
</screen>

scopebits indicates how many bits from the subnet provided in the question
(originally from edns-subnet) were used in determining this answer. This can
aid caching (although PowerDNS does not currently use this value). The auth
field indicates whether this response is authoritative; this is for DNSSEC.

      <sect2><title id="implement-the-any-query">Notes</title>
	<para>
	  Besides regular query types, the DNS also knows the 'ANY' query type. When a server receives 
	  a question for this ANY type, it should reply with all record types available.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Backends should therefore implement being able to answer 'ANY' queries in this way, and supply all
	  record types they have when they receive such an 'ANY' query. This is reflected in the sample script above, 
	  which for every qtype answers if the type matches, or if the query is for 'ANY'.
	</para>
	<para>
	  However, since backends need to implement the ANY query anyhow, PowerDNS makes use of this. Since almost all
	  DNS queries internally need to be translated first into a CNAME query and then into the actual query, possibly 
	  followed by a SOA or NS query (this is how DNS works internally), it makes sense for PowerDNS to speed this up,
	  and just ask the ANY query of a backend.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When it has done so, it gets the data about SOA, CNAME and NS records in one go. This speeds things up tremendously.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The upshot of the above is that for any backend, including the PIPE backend, implementing the ANY query is NOT optional.
	  And in fact, a backend may see almost exclusively ANY queries. This is not a bug.

	  For native operation, either drop the FOREIGN KEY on the domain_id field, or (recommended), make sure

	  <programlisting>
	    insert into domains (name,type) values ('powerdns.com','NATIVE');
	  </programlisting>
	  The records table can now be filled by with the domain_id set to the id of the domains table row just inserted.

      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Slave operation</title>
	<para>
	  These backends are fully slave capable. To become a slave of the 'powerdns.com' domain, execute this:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into domains (name,master,type) values ('powerdns.com','213.244.168.217','SLAVE');
	  </programlisting>
	  And wait a while for PDNS to pick up the addition - which happens within one minute. There is no need to inform PDNS that a new domain
	  was added.
	  Typical output is:
	  <programlisting>
	    Apr 09 13:34:29 All slave domains are fresh
	    Apr 09 13:35:29 1 slave domain needs checking

	</para>
	<para>
	  Periodically, PDNS schedules checks to see if domains are still fresh. The default <command>slave-cycle-interval</command> is 60 seconds, large installations may need to raise this value. Once a domain has been checked, it will not be checked before its SOA refresh timer has expired. Domains whose status is unknown get checked every 60 seconds by default.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Superslave operation</title>
	<para>
	  To configure a supermaster with IP address 10.0.0.11 which lists this installation as 'autoslave.powerdns.com', issue the following:
	  <programlisting>
	    insert into supermasters ('10.0.0.11','autoslave.powerdns.com','internal');
	  </programlisting>
	  From now on, valid notifies from 10.0.0.11 that list a NS record containing 'autoslave.powerdns.com' will lead to the
	  provisioning of a slave domain under the account 'internal'. See <xref linkend="supermaster"/> for details.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2><title>Master operation</title>
	<para>
	  The PostgreSQL backend is fully master capable with automatic discovery of serial changes. Raising the serial number of a domain
	  suffices to trigger PDNS to send out notifications. To configure a domain for master operation instead of the default native replication,
	  issue:

      <para>
        This is the Oracle Database backend, completely rewritten for the 3.0 release, with easily
        configurable SQL statements, allowing you to graft PowerDNS functionality onto any Oracle
        database of your choosing.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Oracle backend is difficult, and possibly illegal, to distribute in binary form. To use it,
        you will probably need to compile PowerDNS from source. OCI headers are expected in
        <filename>$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/public</filename>, and OCI libraries in
        <filename>$ORACLE_HOME/lib</filename>. That is where they should be with a working installation
        of the full Oracle Database client. Oracle InstantClient should work as well, but you will need
        to make the libraries and headers available in appropriate paths.
      </para>
      <para>
        This backend uses two kinds of database connections. First, it opens a session pool.
        Connections from this pool are used only for queries reading DNS data from the database.
        Second, it opens normal (non-pooled) connections on demand for any kind of write access.
        The reason for this split is to allow redundancy by replication. Each DNS frontend
        server can have a local read-only replicated instance of your database. Open the session
        pool to the local replicated copy, and all data will be available with high performance,
        even if the main database goes down. The writing connections should go directly to the
        main database.
      </para>
      <para>
        Of course, if you do not require this kind of redundancy, or want to avoid the substantial
        Oracle Database licensing costs, all connections can just go to the same database with the
        same credentials. Also, the write connections should be entirely unnecessary if you
        do not plan to use either master or slave mode.

                The database to use for read access. OracleBackend will try to create a session
                pool, so make sure this database user has the necessary permissions. If your
                connection requires environment variables to be set, e.g.
                <varname>ORACLE_HOME</varname>, <varname>NLS_LANG</varname>, or
                <varname>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</varname>, make sure these are set when PowerDNS runs.

      <sect2><title>The Database Schema</title>
        <para>
          You can find an example database schema in <filename>schema.sql</filename> in the PowerDNS
          source distribution.  It is intended more as a starting point to come up with a schema that
          works well for your organisation, than as something you should run as it is. As long as the
          semantics of the SQL statements still work out, you can store your DNS data any way you like.
        </para>
        <para>
          You should read this while having <filename>schema.sql</filename> to hand. Columns will not be
          specifically explained where their meaning is obvious.
        </para>
        <note>
          <para>
            All FQDNs should be specified in lower case and without a trailing dot. Where things are
            lexicographically compared or sorted, make sure a sane ordering is used.
            <userinput>NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8</userinput> should generally work well enough;
            when in doubt, enforce a plain ordering with
            <userinput>NLSSORT(value, 'NLS_SORT = BINARY')</userinput>.

                  in all modes. In slave mode, it will additionally attempt to acquire the zone's
                  content from a master server. In master mode, it will additionally send
                  <constant>NOTIFY</constant> packets to other nameservers for the zone when its content
                  changes.

                  This should be a string that consists of the labels of the owner name, in reverse

                  This is used as a quick and dirty way to get canonical zone ordering. You can chose
                  a more correct and much more complicated implementation instead if you prefer.
                  In the reference schema, this is automatically set by a trigger.

                  The NSEC3 hash of the owner name. The reference schema provides code and a trigger to
                  calculate this, but they are not production quality. The recommendation is to load the

        This backend retrieves all data from a SQLite database, which is an RDBMS that's embedded into the application itself, so you won't need to be running a separate server process.
        It also reduces overhead, and simplifies installation.
        At <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org">http://www.sqlite.org</ulink> you can find more information about SQLite.
      </para>
      <para>
        As this is a generic backend, built on top of the gSql framework, you can specify all queries as documented in <link linkend="generic-mypgsql-backends">Generic MySQL and PgSQL backends</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
	SQLite exists in two incompatible versions, numbered 2 and 3, and from 2.9.21 onwards, PowerDNS supports both. It is recommended to go with version 3 
	as it is newer, has better performance and is actively maintained. To use version 3, choose 'launch=gsqlite3'.

      <sect2>
        <title>Compiling the SQLite backend</title>
        <para>
          Before you can begin compiling PowerDNS with the SQLite backend you need to have the SQLite utility and library installed on your system.
          You can download these from <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">http://www.sqlite.org/download.html</ulink>, or you can use packages (if your distribution provides those).
        </para>
        <para>
          When you've installed the library you can use: <command>./configure --with-modules="gsqlite"</command> or
	  <command>./configure --with-modules="gsqlite3"</command> to configure PowerDNS to use the SQLite backend.
          Compilation can then proceed as usual. 
        </para>

	  SQLite is included in most PowerDNS binary releases.

        <title>Setting up the database</title>
	      <para>
	        Before you can use this backend you first have to set it up and fill it with data.	        
	        The default setup conforms to the following schema:
	        
	        <programlisting><xi:include  href="../no-dnssec.schema.sqlite3.sql"  parse="text"  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>
	      </para>
	      <para>
	        This schema contains all elements needed for master, slave and superslave operation.	  
	      </para>
	      <para>
		To support DNSSEC, or to migrate to DNSSEC, the following statements must be issued:
	      </para>
	      <para>
		      <programlisting><xi:include  href="../dnssec.schema.sqlite3.sql"  parse="text"  xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/></programlisting>

	      <para>
		For full migration notes, please see <xref linkend="dnssec-migration"/>.
	      </para>
	      <para>
	        After you have created the database you probably want to fill it with data. 
	        If you have a BIND zone file it's as easy as: <command>zone2sql --zone=myzonefile --gmysql | sqlite powerdns.sqlite</command>, but
	        you can also use AXFR (or insert data manually).
	      </para>
	<para>
	  To communicate with a SQLite database, use either the 'sqlite' or 'sqlite3' program, and feed it SQL.

        <title>Using the SQLite backend</title>

	  On launch, the BindBackend first parses the named.conf to determine which zones need to be loaded. These will then be parsed
	  and made available for serving, as they are parsed. So a named.conf with 100.000 zones may take 20 seconds to load, but after 10 seconds, 
	  50.000 zones will already be available. While a domain is being loaded, it is not yet available, to prevent incomplete answers.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Reloading is currently done only when a request for a zone comes in, and then only after <command>bind-check-interval</command> seconds have passed
	  after the last check. If a change occurred, access to the zone is disabled, the file is reloaded, access is restored, and the question is answered.
	  For regular zones, reloading is fast enough to answer the question which lead to the reload within the DNS timeout.
	</para>
        <para>
          If <command>bind-check-interval</command> is specified as zero, no checks will be performed until the <command>pdns_control reload</command>

      <sect2><title>Performance</title>
	<para>
	  The BindBackend does not benefit from the packet cache as it is fast enough on its own. Furthermore, on most systems, there will
	  be no benefit in using multiple CPUs for the packetcache, so a noticeable speedup can be attained by specifying 
	  <command>distributor-threads=1</command> in <filename>pdns.conf</filename>.

      <sect2><title>Master/slave configuration</title>
	<sect3><title>Master</title>
	  <para>
	    Works as expected. At startup, no notification storm is performed as this is generally not useful. Perhaps in the future the Bind Backend
	    will attempt to store zone metadata in the zone, allowing it to determine if a zone has changed its serial since the last time
	    notifications were sent out.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Changes which are discovered when reloading zones do lead to notifications however.
	  </para>
	</sect3>
	<sect3><title>Slave</title>
	  <para>
	    Also works as expected. The Bind backend expects to be able to write to a directory where a slave domain lives. The incoming zone is stored
	    as 'zonename.RANDOM' and atomically renamed if it is retrieved successfully, and parsed only then.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    In the future, this may be improved so the old zone remains available should parsing fail.

        <para>
Both timestamp and location are supported in the backend. Locations support can be changed using the <command>tinydns-locations</command> setting.
Timestamp and location only work as expected when <command>cache-ttl</command> and <command>query-cache-ttl</command> are set to 0 
(which disables these caches). Timestamp can operate with <command>cache-ttl</command> if cache is needed, but the TTL returned for the 
timestamped racked will not be totally correct. The record will expire once the cache is expired and the backend is queried again. 
Please note that <command>cache-ttl</command> is a performance related setting. See <xref linkend="performance-settings" />.
Location support only exists for IPv4!

      <sect2 id="tinydnsbackend-master-mode"><title>Master mode</title>
        <para>
The TinyDNSBackend supports master mode. This allows it to notify slave nameservers of updates to a zone.
You simply need to rewrite the data.cdb file with an updated/increased serial and PowerDNS will notify the slave nameservers 
of that domain. The <command>tinydns-notify-on-startup</command> configuration setting tells the backend if it should 
notify all the slave nameservers just after startup.

The CDB datafile does not allow PowerDNS to easily query for newly added domains or updated serial numbers.
The CDB datafile requires us to do a full scan of all the records. When running with verbose logging, this could 
lead to a lot of output. The scanning of the CDB file may also take a while on systems with large files. The scan happens 
at an interval set by the <command>slave-cycle-interval</command>. It might be useful to raise
this value to limit the amount of scans on the CDB file.
        </para>
        <para>
The TinyDNSBackend also keeps a list of all the zones. This is needed to detect an updated serial and to give
every zone a unique id. The list is updated when a zone is added, but not when a zone is removed. This leads to some
memory loss.

      PDNS is normally launched by the init.d script but is actually a binary called <filename>pdns_server</filename>. This 
      file is started by the <command>start</command> and <command>monitor</command> commands to the init.d script. Other commands

        The controlsocket is the means to contact a running PDNS daemon, or as we now know, a running <filename>pdns_server</filename>.
        Over this sockets, instructions can be sent using the <filename>pdns_control</filename> program. Like the <filename>pdns_server</filename>,
        this program is normally accessed via the init.d script.

      <sect2 id="pdnscontrol"><title>pdns_control</title>

	<para>
	  To communicate with PDNS over the controlsocket, the <command>pdns_control</command> command is used. The init.d script also calls 
	  pdns_control. The syntax is simple: <command>pdns_control command arguments</command>. Currently this is most useful for telling backends
	  to rediscover domains or to force the transmission of notifications. See <xref linkend="master"/>.

    <sect1 id="guardian"><title>Guardian</title>
      <para>
        When launched by the init.d script, <filename>pdns_server</filename> wraps itself inside a 'guardian'. This guardian monitors the
        performance of the inner <filename>pdns_server</filename> instance which shows up in the process list of your OS as 
        <filename>pdns_server-instance</filename>. 

        It is also this guardian that <filename>pdns_control</filename> talks to. A <command>STOP</command> is interpreted by the guardian, 
        which causes the guardian to sever the connection to the inner process and terminate it, after which it terminates itself.

        The init.d script <command>DUMP</command> and <command>SHOW</command> commands need to access the inner process, because
        the guardian itself does not run a nameserver. For this purpose, the guardian passes controlsocket requests to the control console of the
        inner process. This is the same console as seen with init.d <command>MONITOR</command>.

    <sect1 id="dns-to-query"><title>How PDNS translates DNS queries into backend queries</title>
      <para>
	A DNS query is not a straightforward lookup. Many DNS queries need to check the backend for additional data, for example to
	determine of an unfound record should lead to an NXDOMAIN ('we know about this domain, but that record does not exist') or an 
	unauthoritative response.
      </para>
      <para>
	Simplified, without CNAME processing and wildcards, the algorithm is like this:
      </para>
      <para>
	When a query for a <command>qname</command>/<command>qtype</command> tuple comes in, it is requested directly from the backend. 
	If present, PDNS adds the contents of the reply to the list of records to return. A question tuple may generate multiple answer 
	records.
      </para>
      <para>
	Each of these records is now investigated to see if it needs 'additional processing'. This holds for example for MX records which may
	point to hosts for which the PDNS backends also contain data. This involves further lookups for A or AAAA records.
      </para>
      <para>
	After all additional processing has been performed, PDNS sieves out all double records which may well have appeared. The resulting set of 
	records is added to the answer packet, and sent out.
      </para>
      <para>
	A zone transfer works by looking up the <command>domain_id</command> of the SOA record of the name and then listing all records of that 
	<command>domain_id</command>. This is why all records in a domain need to have the same domain_id.
      </para>
      <para>
	When a query comes in for an unknown domain, PDNS starts looking for SOA records of all subdomains of the qname, so 
	no.such.powerdns.com turns into a SOA query for no.such.powerdns.com, such.powerdns.com, powerdns.com, com, ''. When a SOA is found,
	that zone is consulted for relevant NS instructions which lead to a referral. If nothing is found within the zone, an authoritative 
	NXDOMAIN is sent out.
      </para>
      <para>
	If no SOA was found, an unauthoritative no-error is returned.
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS breaks strict RFC compatibility by not always checking for the presence of a SOA record first. This is unlikely to lead to 
	problems though.

      However, please note that your backend can get queries in aNy CAsE! If your database is case sensitive, like most are (with the notable

	  PowerDNS may instantiate multiple instances of your backend, or destroy existing copies and instantiate new ones. Backend code
	  should therefore be thread-safe with respect to its static data. Additionally, it is wise if instantiation is a fast operation, 
	  with the possible exception of the first construction.

    <sect1 id="simple-backends"><title>Simple read-only native backends</title>
      <para>
	Implementing a backend consists of inheriting from the DNSBackend class. For read-only backends, which do not support slave operation,
	only the following methods are relevant:
	
	<programlisting>
	class DNSBackend
	{
	public:

	virtual void lookup(const QType &amp;qtype, const string &amp;qdomain, DNSPacket *pkt_p=0, int zoneId=-1)=0;
	virtual bool list(const string &amp;target, int domain_id)=0;
	virtual bool get(DNSResourceRecord &amp;r)=0;
	virtual bool getSOA(const string &amp;name, SOAData &amp;soadata, DNSPacket *p=0);
	};
	</programlisting>
      
	Note that the first three methods must be implemented. <function>getSOA()</function> has a useful default implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
	The semantics are simple. Each instance of your class only handles one (1) query at a time. There is no need for locking as PDNS guarantees
	that your backend will never be called reentrantly. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Some examples, a more formal specification is down below. A normal lookup starts like this:
	
	<programlisting>
        YourBackend yb;
	yb.lookup(QType::CNAME,"www.powerdns.com");
	</programlisting>
      
	Your class should now do everything to start this query. Perform as much preparation as possible - handling errors at this stage is better for PDNS 
	than doing so later on. A real error should be reported by throwing an exception. 
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS will then call the <function>get()</function> method to get <command>DNSResourceRecord</command>s back. The following code illustrates
	a typical query:
	
      <programlisting>
	yb.lookup(QType::CNAME,"www.powerdns.com");

	DNSResourceRecord rr;
	while(yb.get(rr))
   	  cout&lt;&lt;"Found cname pointing to '"+rr.content+"'"&lt;&lt;endl;
	}
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Each zone starts with a Start of Authority (SOA) record. This record is special so many backends will choose to implement it
	specially. The default <function>getSOA()</function> method performs a regular lookup on your backend to figure out the SOA, 
	so if you have no special treatment for SOA records, where is no need to implement your own <function>getSOA()</function>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Besides direct queries, PDNS also needs to be able to list a zone, to do zone transfers for example. Each zone has an id which should be
	unique within the backend. To list all records belonging to a zone id, the <function>list()</function> method is used. Conveniently,
	the domain_id is also available in the <command>SOAData</command> structure.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following lists the contents of a zone called "powerdns.com".
      
	<programlisting>
	SOAData sd;
	if(!yb.getSOA("powerdns.com",sd))  // are we authoritative over powerdns.com?
	  return RCode::NotAuth;           // no

	yb.list(sd.domain_id); 
	while(yb.get(rr))
   	  cout&lt;&lt;rr.qname&lt;&lt;"\t IN "&lt;&lt;rr.qtype.getName()&lt;&lt;"\t"&lt;&lt;rr.content&lt;&lt;endl;
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Please note that when so called 'fancy records' (see <xref linkend="fancy-records"/>) are enabled, a backend can receive
	wildcard lookups. These have a % as the first character of the qdomain in lookup. 
      </para>
      <sect2><title>A sample minimal backend</title>

        This simple backend can be used as an 'overlay'. In other words, it only knows about a single record, another loaded backend would have
        to know about the SOA and NS records and such. But nothing prevents us from loading it without another backend.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first part of the code contains the actual logic and should be pretty straightforward. The second part is a boilerplate
        'factory' class which PDNS calls to create randombackend instances. Note that a 'suffix' parameter is passed. Real life backends
        also declare parameters for the configuration file; these get the 'suffix' appended to them. Note that the "random" in the 
        constructor denotes the name by which the backend will be known.
      </para>
      <para>
        The third part registers the RandomFactory with PDNS. This is a simple C++ trick which makes sure that this function
        is called on execution of the binary or when loading the dynamic module.
      </para>
	<para>
	  Please note that a RandomBackend is actually in most PDNS releases. By default it lives on random.example.com, but you can change
	  that by setting <command>random-hostname</command>.

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		This function is used to initiate a straight lookup for a record of name 'qdomain' and type 'qtype'.
		A QType can be converted into an integer by invoking its <function>getCode()</function> method and into
		a string with the <function>getCode()</function>.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		  The original question may or may not be passed in the pointer p. If it is, you can retrieve (from 1.99.11 onwards) 
		  information about who asked the question with the <function>getRemote(DNSPacket *)</function> method. Alternatively, 
		  <function>bool getRemote(struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t *len)</function> is available.
		</para>
		<para>
		  Note that <command>qdomain</command> can be of any case and that your backend should make sure it is in effect case 
		  insensitive. Furthermore, the case of the original question should be retained in answers returned by <function>get()</function>!
		</para>
	      <para>
		Finally, the domain_id might also be passed indicating that only answers from the indicated zone need apply. This
		can both be used as a restriction or as a possible speedup, hinting your backend where the answer might be found.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		If initiated successfully, as indicated by returning <command>true</command>, answers should be made available over the
		<function>get()</function> method.
		</para>
		<para>
		  Should throw an AhuException if an error occurred accessing the database. Returning otherwise indicates that the query 
		  was started successfully. If it is known that no data is available, no exception should be thrown! An exception indicates
		  that the backend considers itself broken - not that no answers are available for a question.

		Request a DNSResourceRecord from a query started by <function>get()</function> of <function>list()</function>. If this functions returns 
		<command>true</command>, <command>rr</command> has been filled with data. When it returns false, no more data is available,

		DNSResourceRecord or resets them to their default values.
	      </para>
		<para>
		  The qname field of the DNSResourceRecord should be filled out with the exact <function>qdomain</function> passed to lookup, preserving
		  its case. So if a query for 'CaSe.yourdomain.com' comes in and your database contains data for 'case.yourdomain.com', the qname field of rr
		  should contain 'CaSe.yourdomain.com'!

    <sect1 id="rw-backends"><title>Read/write slave-capable backends</title>
      <para>
	The backends above are 'natively capable' in that they contain all data relevant for a domain and do not pull in data from other nameservers.
	To enable storage of information, a backend must be able to do more.
      </para>
      <para>
	Before diving into the details of the implementation some theory is in order. Slave domains are pulled from the master. PDNS needs to 
	know for which domains it is to be a slave, and for each slave domain, what the IP address of the master is.
      </para>
      <para>
	A slave zone is pulled from a master, after which it is 'fresh', but this is only temporary. In the SOA record of a zone there is a field
	which specifies the 'refresh' interval. After that interval has elapsed, the slave nameserver needs to check at the master ff the serial
	number there is higher than what is stored in the backend locally.
      </para>
      <para>
	If this is the case, PDNS dubs the domain 'stale', and schedules a transfer of data from the remote. This transfer remains scheduled
	until the serial numbers remote and locally are identical again.
      </para>
      <para>
	This theory is implemented by the <function>getUnfreshSlaveInfos</function> method, which is called on all backends periodically. 
	This method fills a vector of <command>SlaveDomain</command>s with domains that are unfresh and possibly stale. 
      </para>
      <para>
	PDNS then retrieves the SOA of those domains remotely and locally and creates a list of stale domains. For each of these domains, PDNS
	starts a zone transfer to resynchronise. Because zone transfers can fail, it is important that the interface to the backend allows
	for transaction semantics because a zone might otherwise be left in a halfway updated situation.
      </para>

      <sect2><title>Supermaster/Superslave capability</title>
        <para>
          A backend that wants to act as a 'superslave' for a master should implement the following method:
          <programlisting>
            class DNSBackend 
            {
               virtual bool superMasterBackend(const string &amp;ip, const string &amp;domain, const vector&lt;DNSResourceRecord&gt;&amp;nsset, string *account, DNSBackend **db)
            };
          </programlisting>
          This function gets called with the IP address of the potential supermaster, the domain it is sending a notification for and the set of NS records
          for this domain at that IP address. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Using the supplied data, the backend needs to determine if this is a bonafide 'supernotification' which should be honoured. If it decides that it
          should, the supplied pointer to 'account' needs to be filled with the configured name of the supermaster (if accounting is desired), and the 
          db needs to be filled with a pointer to your backend.
        </para>
        <para>

        In order to be a useful master for a domain, notifies must be sent out whenever a domain is changed. Periodically, PDNS
        queries backends for domains that may have changed, and sends out notifications for slave nameservers.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to do so, PDNS calls the <function>getUpdatedMasters()</function> method. Like the <function>getUnfreshSlaveInfos()</function>
        function mentioned above, this should add changed domain names to the vector passed.
      </para>
      <para>
	The following excerpt from the DNSBackend shows the relevant functions:

      <para>
	PowerDNS can be compiled with modules built in, or with modules designed to be loaded at runtime. All that is configured
	before compiling using the well known autoconf/automake system.
      </para>
      <para>
	To compile in modules, specify them as <command>--with-modules="mod1 mod2 mod3"</command>, substituting the desired module names.
	Each backend has a module name in the table at the beginning of its section.
      </para>
      <para>
	To compile a module for inclusion at runtime, which is great if you are a unix vendor, use <command>--with-dynmodules="mod1 mod2 mod3"</command>.

  <appendix id="license"><title>PowerDNS license (GNU General Public License version 2)</title>
    <para>
      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    </para>
    <para>

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
</para><para>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</para><para>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
</para><para>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</para><para>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</para><para>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</para><para>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

</para><para>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</para><para>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</para><para>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</para><para>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
</para><para>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para><para>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
</para><para>

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</para><para>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</para><para>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</para><para>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
</para><para>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
</para><para>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
</para><para>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

</para><para>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</para><para>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
</para><para>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
</para><para>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</para><para>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
</para><para>
			    NO WARRANTY
</para><para>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

</para><para>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  <para>
    In certain legal climates, PowerDNS might potentially require an export control status, particularly 
    since PowerDNS software contains cryptographic primitives.

    PowerDNS does not itself implement any cryptographic algorithms but relies on third party implementations
    of AES, RSA, ECDSA, GOST, MD5 and various SHA-based hashing algorithms. 
  </para>

    For AES, we rely on Brian Gladman's code, as outlined in <xref linkend="further-copyrights"/>. Furthermore,
    RSA, MD5 and the SHA-based algorithms are supplied as a copy of <ulink url="http://www.polarssl.org">PolarSSL</ulink>.

  <para>
    PowerDNS is not "US Origin" software. For re-export, like most open source, publicly available "mass market" projects, PowerDNS is 
    considered to be governed by section 740.13(e) of the US EAR,  "Unrestricted encryption source code", under which PowerDNS source code  
    would be considered re-exportable from the US without an export license under License Exception TSU (Technology and Software - Unrestricted).
  </para>
  <para>
    Like most open source projects containing some encryption, the ECCN that best fits PowerDNS software is 5D002.
