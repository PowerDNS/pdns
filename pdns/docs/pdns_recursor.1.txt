NAME
----
pdns_recursor - high-performance,  simple  and secure recursing nameserver

SYNOPSIS
--------
'pdns_recursor' [--daemon] [--local-address] [--help, -h] [--allow-from]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
pdns_recursor(1) is a high performance,  simple  and  secure  recursing
nameserver.  It currently powers over two million internet connections.


The recursor is configured via a configuration file, but each  item  in
that file can be overridden on the command line.


This  manpage lists the core set of features needed to get the PowerDNS
recursor  working,  for  full  and  up  to   date   details   head   to
http://doc.powerdns.com/built-in-recursor.html


EXAMPLES
--------
To listen on 1.2.3.4 and allow the 1.2.3.0/8 subnet to recurse, and run
as a daemon, execute:

	# pdns_recursor --local-address=1.2.3.4 --allow-from=1.2.3.0/8 --daemon

To stop the recursor by hand, run:

	# rec_control quit


       Alternatively, use the init.d script provided.

OPTIONS
-------
For authoritative listing of options, consult the documentation referenced above.

--aaaa-additional-processing::
	turn on to do AAAA additional processing (slow)

--allow-from::
	If set, only allow these comma separated netmasks to recurse

--auth-can-lower-ttl::
	Authoritative zones can transmit a TTL value that is lower than that specified in the parent zone. This is called a
	'delegation inconsistency'. To follow RFC 2181 paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 to the letter, enable this feature.
	This will mean a slight deterioration of performance, and it will not solve any problems, but does make
	the recursor more standards compliant. Not recommended unless you have to tick an 'RFC 2181 compliant' box. Off by default.

--auth-zones::
           Comma separated list of 'zonename=filename' pairs. Zones read from
           these files are served authoritatively. Example: auth-zones=
           ds9a.nl=/var/zones/ds9a.nl, powerdns.com=/var/zones/powerdns.com.
           Available since 3.1.

--chroot::
	switch to chroot jail

--client-tcp-timeout::
	Timeout in seconds when talking to TCP clients

--config-dir::
	Location of configuration directory (recursor.conf)

--daemon::
	Operate as a daemon

--delegation-only::
	Which domains we only accept delegations from

--entropy-source::
	Where to read new entropy from, defaults to /dev/urandom.

--export-etc-hosts::
           If set, this flag will export the host names and IP addresses
           mentioned in /etc/hosts. Available since 3.1.
--fork::
	If set, fork the daemon for possible double performance

--forward-zones::
           Comma separated list of 'zonename=IP' pairs. Queries for zones
           listed here will be forwarded to the IP address listed.
           forward-zones= ds9a.nl=213.244.168.210, powerdns.com=127.0.0.1.
           Available since 3.1. For more details, see the manual.

--forward-zones-file::
           listed here will be forwarded to the IP address listed.
           One zone per line, like: ds9a.nl=213.244.168.210
           Available since 3.1.5. For more details, see the manual.

--hint-file::
	If set, load root hints from this file

--local-address::
	IP addresses to listen on, separated by spaces or commas

--local-port::
	port to listen on

--log-common-errors::
	If we should log rather common errors

--max-cache-entries::
	If set, maximum number of entries in the main cache

--max-negative-ttl::
	maximum number of seconds to keep a negative cached entry in memory

--max-tcp-clients::
	Maximum number of simultaneous TCP clients

--max-tcp-per-client::
	If set, maximum number of TCP sessions per client (IP address)

--query-local-address::
	Source IP address for sending queries

--query-local-address6::
	Send out local IPv6 queries from this address. Disabled by default,
	which also disables outgoing IPv6 support. A useful setting is
	'::0'.

--quiet::
	Suppress logging of questions and answers

--remotes-ringbuffer-entries::
	maximum number of packets to store statistics for

--server-id::
	Returned when queried for 'server.id' TXT, defaults to hostname

--serve-rfc1918::
	On by default, this makes the server authoritatively aware of: 10.in-addr.arpa,
	168.192.in-addr.arpa and 16-31.172.in-addr.arpa, which saves load on the AS112
	servers. Individual parts of these zones can still be loaded or forwarded.

--setgid::
	If set, change group id to this gid for more security

--setuid::
	If set, change user id to this uid for more security

--single-socket::
	If set, only use a single socket for outgoing queries

--socket-dir::
	Where the controlsocket will live

--spoof-nearmiss-max::
	If non-zero, assume spoofing after this many near misses

--trace::
	if we should output heaps of logging

--version-string::
	string reported on version.pdns or version.bind
