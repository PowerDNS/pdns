pdns-recursor (3.6.2-1) rec-3.6; urgency=low
  * commit ab14b4f: expedite servfail generation for ezdns-like failures (fully abort query resolving if we hit more than 50 outqueries)
  * commit 42025be: PowerDNS now polls the security status of a release at startup and periodically. More detail on this feature, and how to turn it off, can be found in Section 2, “Security polling”.
  * commit 5027428: We did not transmit the right 'local' socket address to Lua for TCP/IP queries in the recursor. In addition, we would attempt to lookup a filedescriptor that wasn't there in an unlocked map which could conceivably lead to crashes. Closes ticket 1828, thanks Winfried for reporting
  * commit 752756c: Sync embedded yahttp copy. API: Replace HTTP Basic auth with static key in custom header
  * commit 6fdd40d: add missing #include <pthread.h> to rec-channel.hh (this fixes building on OS X).
