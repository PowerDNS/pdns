We allow to add/remove the NSEC3PARAM record, this test confirms that everything
is working correctly. The test operates a bit different when in NSEC mode, as we
don't add a NSEC3PARAM at the end. In NSEC3-NARROW mode, we do add NSEC3PARAM's
at the end, but these are then in non-narrow mode as we cannot specify narrow
mode in the NSEC3PARAM and the delete of the NSEC3PARAM also removed the narrow
flag.
