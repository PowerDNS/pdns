UDP dns packets can only be 512 bytes long - when they are longer, they need
to get truncated, and have the 'TC' bit set, to inform the client that they
need to requery over TCP. This query however does not need truncation, since
the information that causes things to go over limit are 'courtesy' additionals.
But truncation is harmless and will avoid a lot of additional complexity.
